# **INTRODUCTION**

**Necromunda** is a sprawling, evolving game, with numerous rules published since its 2017 version. These rules vary across publications, with some contradictions. The community has created compilations to keep the game playable. The goal of this website is to make the rules clear and accessible, consolidating all content from the 2017 release onwards. Initially based on the Necrodamus rules compilation, the 2023 Core Rules are now used verbatim (RAW), covering both these and previous publications.

**Note:** All original content is owned by Games Workshop and published here without permission. Supporting the game by purchasing gangs and their corresponding House/Books is encouraged, as Necromunda is narrative-rich with extensive backstories.

The essential elements for playing Necromunda include models for fighters and vehicles, and terrain for the battlefield. Other necessary items include:

## **MARKERS**

Markers represent various model statuses and conditions, track lost Wounds or Hull Points, and can be placed on the battlefield or on Fighter/Vehicle cards. Examples include:

- **Ready markers**: Indicate a model is ready for activation.
- **Out of Ammo markers**: Show a weapon is out of ammunition or malfunctioned.
- **Blaze markers**: Signify a model is on fire or ‘subject to the Blaze condition’.

## **TEMPLATES**

All distances in Necromunda are measured in inches. Pre-measuring is not allowed, and ranges are measured only when required by the rules.

## **VISION ARC TEMPLATE**

A triangular template to determine a model’s vision arc quickly and easily.

## **FIGHTER AND VEHICLE CARDS**

Each fighter and vehicle is represented by a card filled with their characteristics and equipment. These cards provide a reference during battle and can be used to place markers, keeping the battlefield uncluttered.

## **YAKTRIBE**

## **NECROMUNDA DICE**

- **D6**: A regular six-sided dice, often with a special logo on the '6'.
- **D3**: Rolled by halving the result of a D6, rounding up.
- **Firepower Dice**: Used for ranged attacks to determine ammunition depletion or malfunction.

# **GANG FIGHTERS & THEIR WEAPONRY**

In Necromunda, players control a ‘gang’ composed of models referred to as ‘fighters’ or ‘vehicles’. Each model is of a named type, representing a rank within the gang’s hierarchy (e.g., Leader, Ganger, Underhive Scum, Brute). The terms ‘fighter’, ‘vehicle’, or ‘model’ encompass all within the rules.

These rules cover a comprehensive range of actions for both fighters and vehicles, guiding players on how to maneuver and engage in combat in the diverse and dangerous environments of Necromunda.

### **Vehicles and Difficult Terrain**

*Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)*

Vehicles in Necromunda interact with different terrain types based on their locomotion method. These methods are defined under the Locomotion special rules.

### Locomotion Special Rules

1. **Wheeled**: Counts as moving 2" for every 1" in difficult terrain.
2. **Tracked**: Ignores movement penalties over difficult terrain.
3. **Skimmers**: Skips all difficult and dangerous terrain but requires a Handling test if ending on such terrain; failure leads to a Catastrophic hit to the Drive.
4. **Walker**: Can turn freely and counts as moving 2" for every 1" in difficult terrain.

### Vehicles and Dangerous Terrain

Vehicles crossing dangerous terrain must pass a Handling check to avoid a Catastrophic Hit to the Drive. Failing this check results in immediate damage.

### Fighter Movement on Vehicles

Fighters interact with vehicles like terrain, climbing and jumping on them. Balancing on a moving vehicle is challenging:

- Fighters (excluding those in transport spaces) on moving vehicles must pass an Initiative check or fall off.
- If they fall, they are placed 1" away in a direction determined by the Scatter dice.
- Falling near impassable terrain or edges requires additional checks.
- Objects like Loot caskets fall off unless secured by a successful Initiative check.

### Vehicle Impacts

*Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)*

### **Running Over Fighters**

- Fighters moved by a vehicle must pass an Initiative test or suffer a hit.
- Seriously Injured fighters pass only on a natural 6.

### **Vehicle Collision Damage Table**

- Impact strength varies based on the vehicle's Movement characteristic.
- Collisions involve Strength, AP, and Damage calculations.

### **Types of Collisions**

- **Head-On Collisions**: Depend on Toughness comparison; can push impacted vehicles.
- **Side-On Collisions**: Require Handling tests; failure leads to adjustment of the active vehicle's course.

### **Colliding with Terrain**

- Collisions with sturdy structures treat the vehicle as having collided with a tougher opponent.
- Collisions with flimsy structures destroy them, potentially causing falls.

### Terrain

*Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)*

Terrain plays a significant role in Necromunda, affecting movement and interactions.

### **Difficult Terrain**

- Movement through difficult terrain counts as double.

### **Dangerous Terrain**

- Crossing requires Initiative or Handling tests to avoid going Out of Action or suffering a Catastrophic hit.

### **Obstacles**

- Fighters crossing obstacles reduce their movement by the obstacle's height.
- Vehicles destroy obstacles when crossing but may take damage.

### **Structures (Sturdy & Flimsy)**

- Fighters can climb structures; vehicles may damage them upon collision.
- Flimsy structures can be destroyed by vehicle collisions.

### **Impassable Terrain & Solid Terrain Features**

- Impassable terrain cannot be traversed by models.
- Ductways in Zone Mortalis battles allow crossing through certain impassable terrain using a specific action.

These rules provide a comprehensive framework for how vehicles and fighters interact with various terrain types in Necromunda, adding depth and tactical complexity to the game.

**Climbing:**

- Fighters can climb vertical surfaces to reach higher levels.
- Movement is counted as 2" for every 1" climbed vertically.
- Fighters must finish their activation on a flat surface unless in the middle of a Move (Simple) action.

**Leaping Gaps:**

- Fighters can leap gaps bigger than their base if they have sufficient Movement.
- An Initiative test determines success; failure results in falling.

**Jumping Down:**

- Fighters can jump down to lower levels or disembark from vehicles.
- An Initiative test is required, with modifiers based on the height jumped.

**Falling Hazards:**

- Fighters risk falling if they become Prone within ½" of an edge.
- An Initiative test determines if they fall, with railings providing a bonus to the test.

**Falling:**

- Falling fighters take hits based on the distance fallen, rounded up.
- They become Prone and Pinned, and their activation ends.
- If they land on another fighter, both are affected similarly.

**Vehicles and Falling:**

- Vehicles can fall off elevated heights due to various reasons.
- They must pass a Loss of Control test and take hits as described in the rules.

**Shooting:**

- Involves assessing target priority, declaring the shot, measuring range, making the hit roll, and resolving hits.
- Target priority requires targeting the closest eligible enemy unless a Cool test allows otherwise.
- Various modifiers apply to the hit roll, including cover and engagement status.

> Most of the faces on the Firepower dice feature a number of bullet holes: one, two or three. In most cases, rolling one of these symbols means the weapon hasn’t run out of ammo, jammed or otherwise malfunctioned. If, however, the weapon being fired has the Rapid Fire (X) trait, the number of bullet holes rolled indicates the number of shots made.

This symbol indicates that the weapon has run out of ammo, jammed or malfunctioned, and that an Ammo roll is required. Rolling this symbol doesn’t mean that the attack itself misses, based on the Ballistic Skill test the attack may still hit its target. However, regardless of the Ballistic Skill test, something has gone wrong and an Ammo test must be made.

**Ammo Checks:**

- When the ammo check symbol (an empty bullet casing) is rolled, it indicates an ammo problem like running out of ammo, jamming, or malfunction.
- An Ammo test is required when this symbol is rolled, regardless of whether the Ballistic Skill test for the attack was successful.

**Multiple Weapon Profiles:**

- Weapons with multiple profiles (e.g., shotguns with different ammo types) must declare the profile being used when attacking.
- If an Ammo test is failed for one profile, it is considered failed for all profiles.
- The weapon can't be used until a successful Reload (Simple) action is performed.

**Blast Markers:**

- Used with weapons having the Blast (X) trait, allowing targeting a point on the battlefield instead of a model.
- Placement involves a scatter mechanic if the attack misses.
- All models under the Blast marker are hit by the attack.

**Flame Templates:**

- Weapons with the Template trait use the Flame template to determine hits.
- The template is placed with the narrow end touching the attacker's base, hitting models beneath it automatically.

**Cover and Templates:**

- Models in partial or full cover from a Blast marker or Flame template receive a positive modifier to their Save roll.
- Partial cover grants a +1 modifier, and full cover grants a +2 modifier.

**Close Combat:**

- Fighters engaged with an enemy can make close combat attacks using Melee or Sidearm weapons.
- The sequence includes turning to face, choosing weapons, determining attack dice, declaring targets, making hit rolls, resolving hits, reaction attacks, and consolidating or executing a coup de grace.

**Charging Prone or Out of Line of Sight Fighters:**

- Charging a prone fighter changes their status to Standing and Engaged.
- Charging fighters not in line of sight incurs a -1 modifier to hit rolls.

**Combat Details:**

- Fighters can turn to face any direction, but this may cause a -1 modifier to hit rolls.
- Fighters can use up to two Melee or Sidearm weapons, or make unarmed attacks.
- The number of attack dice is based on the fighter's Attacks characteristic, with modifiers for dual wielding or charging.

### Dual Weapons with the Melee or Sidearm trait (+1)
- **Charging (+1):** If the fighter is attacking with more than one weapon, the Attack dice must be split as evenly as possible between the two weapons, ideally allocating an equal number of Attack dice to each weapon. Where this is not possible, for instance, if the fighter has an odd number of Attacks to make, the controlling player may choose which weapon is allocated the extra Attack dice.

### Pistols at Close Quarters
- A weapon with the Sidearm trait can only have one Attack dice allocated to it. Any remaining Attack dice must be allocated to a weapon with the Melee trait. If a fighter has no other weapons with the Melee trait, any remaining Attack dice must be allocated to Unarmed attacks, as described previously.
- If a fighter attacks with a weapon with the Sidearm trait in close combat, Accuracy modifiers do not apply – this is only used when making ranged attacks.

### INFO
#### FIGHTING ACROSS BARRICADES
- A fighter that is in base contact with an obstacle that is less than 1" wide counts as being engaged with an enemy fighter if that enemy fighter is in base contact with the other side of the obstacle, even though the fighters themselves are not in base to base contact. Fighters armed with weapons with the Versatile trait can fight across wider obstacles if the enemy fighter is within the range of the weapon.

#### 4. DECLARE TARGETS
- When a fighter makes a close combat attack, it must be against an eligible target. An eligible target is an enemy model that is within the vision arc of the fighter, and that the fighter is Engaging. If there is more than one eligible target, close combat attacks can be split between them as the player wishes.

#### 5. MAKE HIT ROLL(S)
- Each Attack dice is used to make a Hit roll. A Hit roll is a Weapon Skill test made against the WS of the attacking fighter. Roll separately for each different weapon being used by the fighter and/or for different targets.
- Hit rolls may be modified by +1 for each assist from a friendly fighter also engaged with the target, or by -1 for each enemy fighter also Engaging the attacker.
- Note that BS is not used to make Hit rolls in close combat, even when a ranged weapon with the Sidearm trait is used. When making a Hit roll for a weapon with the Sidearm trait, a WS test is made, exactly as described above.
- Rolls of a Natural 1: If, when making a close combat attack, the Hit roll is a natural 1, the attack automatically misses, regardless of any modifiers that may apply.

#### 6. RESOLVE HITS
- Each attack that scores a hit is resolved as described in Resolving Hits.

#### 7. REACTION ATTACKS
- If there are still enemies that are Standing and Engaged with the attacker, they may make Reaction attacks, following steps 1-6.

### INFO
#### ATTACKING VEHICLES
- A fighter that is within 1" of a vehicle may make close combat attacks against it as if they were engaged with that vehicle, though in all other respects they count as Standing and Active. When a fighter makes a close combat attack against a vehicle, they may apply a +1 modifier to the Hit roll. A fighter Engaging a vehicle in close combat may roll an additional Location dice, choosing one result to apply and discarding the other(s).
- A vehicle never counts as being engaged and may freely move out of engagement range of enemy fighters, however, when it does those fighters may make an Initiative test, and can make Reaction attacks against the vehicle if they pass.
- A fighter attacking a vehicle cannot gain the benefits of assists. Additionally, vehicles cannot make Reaction attacks and can never grant assists to friendly fighters.
- Any hits scored in close combat are resolved against the Toughness value of the facing they are in contact with. If a fighter is on the vehicle, resolve them against the lowest Toughness. If a fighter wrecks a vehicle, they may consolidate as described previously.

#### 8. CONSOLIDATE OR COUP DE GRACE
- If all enemy models the attacker was engaged with are now either Prone and Seriously Injured or Wrecked, the fighter may make a free Coup De Grace (Simple) action against one such enemy fighter.
- Alternatively, if all enemy models the attacker was engaged with are now Prone and Seriously Injured, have gone Out of Action or are Wrecked, the fighter may move up to 2" in any direction.

### ASSISTS & INTERFERENCE
Engaging more than one opponent is much more difficult than Engaging a lone fighter. When making close combat attacks, a fighter can claim ‘assists’ from friendly fighters who are also engaged with the target of the attack, and can suffer ‘interference’ from enemy fighters other than the target of the attack who are also engaged with them.

#### ASSISTS
- When a fighter makes a close combat attack, they can claim an assist from each other friendly fighter that is:
    - Engaged with the target of the attack.
    - Not engaged with any other fighters from the same gang as the target of the attack.
- Each assist claimed in this way adds a +1 modifier to the Hit roll.

#### INTERFERENCE
- When a fighter makes a close combat attack, they may suffer interference from each other enemy fighter that is:
    - Engaged with the attacker.
    - Not engaged with any other fighters from the same gang as the attacker.
- Each interference causes a -1 modifier to apply to the Hit roll.

### RESOLVE HITS
**Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)**

Whenever a successful Hit roll is made against a model, there is a good chance that hit will cause that model to suffer a degree of damage. Determining how badly damaged a model is and what the effects of that damage are differs between fighters and vehicles.

#### RESOLVING HITS AGAINST FIGHTERS
When a fighter suffers a Hit, follow this sequence:

1. **MAKE WOUND ROLL**
    - Whenever a Wound roll is made against a fighter, it is always the opposing player that makes it. Cross-reference the weapon’s Strength with the hit fighter’s Toughness and roll a D6 on the table below to determine if the fighter is wounded by the attack:

        | Strength vs Toughness | D6 Roll Required |
        |-----------------------|------------------|
        | Is the Strength TWICE the Toughness or greater? | 2+ |
        | Is the Strength GREATER than the Toughness? | 3+ |
        | Is the Strength EQUAL to the Toughness? | 4+ |
        | Is the Strength LOWER than the Toughness? | 5+ |
        | Is the Strength HALF the Toughness or lower? | 6+ |

2. **MAKE A SAVE ROLL**
    - If a hit results in a successful Wound roll, or leads to an Injury roll being made against the fighter for any reason, the fighter may be able to make a Save roll.
    - Only one Save roll may be made for each hit that successfully wounds, or leads to an Injury roll being made, regardless of how many different Save rolls a fighter may have. For example, if a fighter wears both mesh armour and a refractor field, they may only attempt a Save roll against a successful Wound roll with one of those items.
    - Save rolls are made either:
        - After the Wound roll is made but before the Wound is removed from the fighter, in which case the Wound is ‘saved’ and not removed.
        - If the attack has a Damage ‘-’ characteristic and causes an Injury dice to be rolled against the fighter for any reason, a Save roll is made before any Injury dice are rolled.
    - Players should note that some weapon traits will disallow Save rolls. For example, the Gas Weapon trait states that no Save roll can be made. In such cases, regardless of any modifiers, no Save roll can be made.
    - Armour Penetration: It may happen that the Armour Penetration (AP) characteristic of a weapon is greater than the Save roll granted by the armour a fighter wears, thus canceling out the Save roll. For example, a fighter wearing mesh armour has a Save roll of 5+, but if they are hit by a weapon with AP -3, no Save roll would be possible.
    - Positive Save Modifiers: In some situations, such as a fighter benefiting from partial or full cover against an attack that uses a Blast marker, a fighter’s Save roll may be improved. In such situations, this positive modifier may be added to a fighter’s normal Save roll but may not be added to Field armour. For example, if a fighter wearing mesh armour (5+ save) and a displacer field (4+ save) gains a +1 modifier to their Save roll, they may improve their mesh armour save to 4+ but may not improve their displacer field save to 3+.
    - If a fighter not wearing armour benefits from a positive save modifier, treat their save as 7+ for the purposes of modification. For example, if a fighter wearing no armour gains a +2 save modifier, they will be able to make a Save roll of 5+.
    - Rolls of a Natural 1: A roll of a natural 1 when making a Save roll is always an automatic failure, regardless of any modifiers that may apply.

## LASTING INJURIES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injuries)

Whenever a fighter goes Out of Action, the opposing player immediately rolls two D6, one after the other (a D66 roll) and looks up the result on the Lasting Injuries table (see opposite). During Campaign play, the result is applied against the fighter and a note of the Lasting Injury made on the Gang Roster.

If an Injury roll results in more than one Out of Action result, a separate roll for each is made on the Lasting Injuries table and each result is applied.

Rolling for Lasting Injuries must be done during Campaign play. Should players wish, they can forgo this step during Skirmish play, though making the roll and noting the result can add greatly to the narrative of the battle.

HOUSE RULE (A&A)

When a fighter goes Out of Action, only make one Lasting Injury roll, regardless of the number of Out of Action dice.

### GOING INTO CONVALESCENCE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#going-into-convalescence)

Some results will cause a fighter to go into Convalescence. During Campaign play, this means that the fighter cannot perform any post-battle actions or work any Territories. However, unlike going into Recovery, they will be available to fight in the gang’s next battle.

### GOING INTO RECOVERY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#going-into-recovery)

Some results will cause a fighter to go into Recovery. During Campaign play, this means that the fighter cannot take part in their gang’s next battle, as they are recovering from their injuries.

The fighter’s In Recovery box on the gang roster is checked, and the fighter must miss both the post- battle sequence of the current battle and their gang’s next battle. This means that a fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule that has gone into Recovery may not perform post-battle actions at this time. During the Wrap-up of the gang’s next battle, the fighter’s In Recovery box will be cleared, the fighter becomes available once again and Leaders and Champions may perform post-battle actions.

Note that no matter how many Lasting Injury rolls are made, a fighter that goes into Recovery will only miss one battle rather than multiple battles.

### FALLING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#falling)

As described in [Terrain: Falling](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/terrain#falling), should a model ever fall 3" or more, they will suffer an automatic hit. The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined by how far the model fell, rounded up to the nearest inch:

| Distance Fallen | Strength | AP | Damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3"-5" | 3 | - | 1 |
| 6"-7" | 5 | -1 | 1 |
| 8"-9" | 7 | -2 | 2 |

### CHARACTERISTIC REDUCTIONS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#characteristic-reductions)

Some results on the Lasting Injury table cause a permanent reduction to a fighter’s characteristics. Their Fighter card must be amended immediately and a note of the injury suffered made in the Captured By/Lasting Injury box of the gang roster for the injured fighter – note that their Credits value does not change. No characteristic may ever be reduced below the [minimum shown on the table](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/fighter-profiles#fighter-characteristics-profiles). Should a Lasting Injury cause a characteristic to be reduced below the minimum, the characteristic is not reduced.

### LASTING INJURY TABLE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injury-table)

| D66 | Lasting Injury |
| --- | --- |
| 11 | Lesson Learned: The fighter goes into Convalescence but gains D3 Experience. |
| 12 | Impressive Scars: The fighter gains a set of impressive scars as testament to their bravery. Increase the fighter’s Cool by 1. This bonus only applies once, treat all further results as Out Cold. |
| 13 | Horrid Scars: The fighter has been horrifically disfigured, leaving them with a fearsome visage. The fighter gains the https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#2-fearsome skill. If they already have the Fearsome skill, treat this result as Out Cold. |
| 14 | Bitter Enmity: The fighter bears a bitter grudge against the gang that inflicted this injury. When fighting a battle against the gang that inflicted this injury, the fighter gains the https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#1-berserker skill. If they already have the Berserker skill or roll this result a second time, treat it as Out Cold. |
| 15-26 | Out Cold: The fighter misses the rest of the battle, but avoids any long term injuries. The fighter recovers in time to perform post-battle actions. |
| 31-36 | Convalescence: The fighter goes into Convalescence. |
| 41 | Old Battle Wound: At the end of each battle this fighter participates in roll a D6, on a 1 the fighter goes into Convalescence. |
| 42 | Partially Deafened: The fighter suffers no penalty if they are partially deafened, however, suffering this injury again reduces their Leadership by 1. |
| 43 | Humiliated: The fighter goes into Convalescence and their Leadership and Cool characteristics are each decreased by 1. |
| 44 | Eye Injury: The fighter goes into Recovery and their Ballistic Skill characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 45 | Hand Injury: The fighter goes into Recovery and their Weapon Skill characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 46 | Hobbled: The fighter goes into Recovery and their Movement characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 51 | Spinal Injury: The fighter goes into Recovery and their Strength characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 52 | Enfeebled: The fighter goes into Recovery and their Toughness characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 53 | Head Injury: The fighter goes into Recovery and their Intelligence and Willpower characteristics are each decreased by 1. |
| 54 | Multiple Injuries: The fighter is not dead but has suffered many serious wounds. Roll a further D3 times on this table re-rolling any results of Captured, Multiple Injuries, Memorable Death, Critical Injury or Out Cold. |
| 55-56 | Captured: The fighter might be https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#being-captured. |
| 61-65 | Critical Injury: The fighter is in a critical condition – if their injuries are not successfully treated by a visit to the Doc (see https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#medical-escort) in the post-battle sequence, they will die. |
| 66 | Memorable Death: The fighter is killed instantly – not even the most talented Doc can save them. If the injury was caused by an Attack action, the attacker gains 1 additional XP. |

## LASTING INJURIES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#lasting-injuries)

Whenever a fighter goes Out of Action, the opposing player immediately rolls two D6, one after the other (a D66 roll) and looks up the result on the Lasting Injuries table (see opposite). During Campaign play, the result is applied against the fighter and a note of the Lasting Injury made on the Gang Roster.

If an Injury roll results in more than one Out of Action result, a separate roll for each is made on the Lasting Injuries table and each result is applied.

Rolling for Lasting Injuries must be done during Campaign play. Should players wish, they can forgo this step during Skirmish play, though making the roll and noting the result can add greatly to the narrative of the battle.

HOUSE RULE (A&A)

When a fighter goes Out of Action, only make one Lasting Injury roll, regardless of the number of Out of Action dice.

### GOING INTO CONVALESCENCE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#going-into-convalescence)

Some results will cause a fighter to go into Convalescence. During Campaign play, this means that the fighter cannot perform any post-battle actions or work any Territories. However, unlike going into Recovery, they will be available to fight in the gang’s next battle.

### GOING INTO RECOVERY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#going-into-recovery)

Some results will cause a fighter to go into Recovery. During Campaign play, this means that the fighter cannot take part in their gang’s next battle, as they are recovering from their injuries.

The fighter’s In Recovery box on the gang roster is checked, and the fighter must miss both the post- battle sequence of the current battle and their gang’s next battle. This means that a fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule that has gone into Recovery may not perform post-battle actions at this time. During the Wrap-up of the gang’s next battle, the fighter’s In Recovery box will be cleared, the fighter becomes available once again and Leaders and Champions may perform post-battle actions.

Note that no matter how many Lasting Injury rolls are made, a fighter that goes into Recovery will only miss one battle rather than multiple battles.

### FALLING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#falling)

As described in [Terrain: Falling](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/terrain#falling), should a model ever fall 3" or more, they will suffer an automatic hit. The Strength, AP and Damage of this hit is determined by how far the model fell, rounded up to the nearest inch:

| Distance Fallen | Strength | AP | Damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3"-5" | 3 | - | 1 |
| 6"-7" | 5 | -1 | 1 |
| 8"-9" | 7 | -2 | 2 |
| 10"+ | 9 | -3 | 3 |

## NERVE TESTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#nerve-tests)

Seeing friends and comrades suffering serious injury can have quite a profound effect upon even the most hardened of underhive gangers. Therefore, fighters have to take a Nerve test when a friendly fighter is Prone and Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action within 3" of them, or a friendly vehicle is Wrecked within 6" of them.

All fighters must test regardless of their Status and Secondary Status, though it should be noted that some fighters may be subject to a special rule that makes them immune to Nerve tests.

NOTE

No Nerve test is required when a Juve/Prospect is taken Out of Action, except by other Juves/Prospects.

To make a Nerve test, make a Cool test for the fighter, applying a +1 modifier for each friendly fighter within 3" of them that is not Broken and is not Prone and Seriously Injured:

- If the test is passed, nothing happens.
- If the test is failed, the fighter becomes Broken. Place a Broken marker on their Fighter card to indicate that the fighter is subject to the Broken condition:
    - As soon as a fighter becomes Broken, they will immediately activate (even if they have already been activated this round) and make a [Running for Cover (Double)](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/fighter-actions#running-for-cover-double) action.
    - If the fighter is Ready, they lose their Ready marker.
- Broken fighters may be rallied in the End phase, as described in [Rally Tests](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#4-rally-tests).
- When a Broken fighter activates in a subsequent round, they may not make any actions other than Running for Cover (Double).
- If a Broken fighter is engaged by an enemy fighter, they may only make Reaction attacks with a -2 modifier.

INFO

### VEHICLES AND NERVE TESTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#vehicles-and-nerve-tests)

Whilst seeing fighters taken out does not faze the average vehicle driver (after all, they are protected inside their vehicle), they may become panicked upon seeing other vehicles destroyed. Therefore, vehicles have to take a Nerve test whenever a friendly vehicle is Wrecked with 6" of them. All vehicles must test regardless of their Status and Secondary Status, though some vehicles may be subject to a special rule that makes them immune to Nerve tests.

To make a Nerve test, make a Cool test for the vehicle, applying a +1 modifier for each friendly vehicle within 6" of them that is not Broken and is not Stationary and Wrecked:

- If the test is passed, nothing happens.
- If the test is failed, the vehicle becomes Broken. Place a Broken marker on their Vehicle card to indicate that the vehicle is subject to the Broken condition:
    - As soon as a vehicle becomes Broken, they will immediately activate (even if they have already been activated this round) and if mobile will make a [Break For Air (Double)](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/vehicle-actions#break-for-air-double) action, or if Stationary and Stalled make a [Burn Out (Double)](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/vehicle-actions#burn-out-double) action.
    - If the vehicle is Ready, they lose their Ready marker.
- Broken vehicles may be rallied in the End phase, as described in [Rally Tests](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#4-rally-tests).
- When a Broken vehicle activates in a subsequent round, they may not make any actions other than Break For Air (Double) if Mobile or Burn Out (Double) if Stationary and Stalled.

# RESOLVING HITS AGAINST VEHICLES

*Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)*

When a vehicle suffers a Hit, follow this sequence:

1. Determine Facing of Attack
2. Make Wound Roll
3. Make Save Roll
4. Determine Damage

## 1. DETERMINE FACING OF ATTACK[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#1-determine-facing-of-attack)

As noted in [Vehicle Characteristics](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/vehicle-profiles#vehicle-characteristics--characteristic-tests), all vehicles have three Toughness characteristics: Front, Side and Rear – each of which corresponds to the vehicle’s different vision arcs, as shown in the diagram below.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7b0e0e6-24b9-4da8-8ab2-a5c5242f7825/01692a27-0b5d-4e5a-9315-7ebf43e42e5e/Untitled.png)

Every hit a vehicle suffers is resolved against one of these ‘facings’. Which facing has been hit depends upon where the attacking model is in relation to the vehicle. To determine this, imaginary lines are drawn from the vehicle, as shown in the diagram; whichever arc the centre of the attacking model’s base (or central hole in the case of a [Blast marker](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/shooting#blast-markers)) is in is the facing hit.

If there is ever any doubt as to which facing has been hit (for example, if the imaginary line runs through the centre of the attacking model), the better Toughness value is always used.

INFO

### HULL DOWN VEHICLES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#hull-down-vehicles)

Sometimes, the attacking model will not be able to see any of the vehicle facing whose arc they are in. In these cases the vehicle is said to be hull down, and gains the benefit of being in Full Cover even if not sufficiently obscured.

## 2. MAKE WOUND ROLL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#2-make-wound-roll)

Whenever a Wound roll is made against a vehicle, it is always the opposing player that makes it. Cross reference the weapon’s Strength with the Toughness of the facing hit on the vehicle and roll a D6 on the table below to determine if the vehicle is wounded by the attack:

| Strength vs Toughness | D6 Roll Required |
| --- | --- |
| Is the Strength TWICE the Toughness or greater? | 2+ |
| Is the Strength GREATER than the Toughness? | 3+ |
| Is the Strength EQUAL to the Toughness? | 4+ |
| Is the Strength LOWER than the Toughness? | 5+ |
| Is the Strength HALF the Toughness or lower? | 6+ |

## 3. MAKE SAVE ROLL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#3-make-save-roll)

If a hit results in a successful Wound roll, or leads to a Damage roll being made against the vehicle for any reason, the vehicle may be able to make a Save roll. This is done in exactly the [same way as for fighters](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#2-make-a-save-roll).

## 4. DETERMINE DAMAGE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#4-determine-damage)

Following an unsuccessful Save roll, instead of inflicting damage as normal, the opposing player should roll both the Damage dice and Location dice simultaneously. It is always the opposing player that rolls Damage dice and Location dice.

### A. LOCATION HIT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#a-location-hit)

One or more Location dice are rolled to determine the exact location hit.

In some cases, it will be impossible to hit a certain location from a specific facing (as described in the vehicle’s special rules). Should it ever occur that an impossible location has been hit, simply re-roll the Location dice until a location that can be hit is rolled.

### MULTIPLE LOCATION DICE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#multiple-location-dice)

Players should note that, in some cases, more than one Location dice is rolled. When this is the case, it is usual for the player that made the roll to choose a single result to resolve and discard the other dice. Sometimes, however, it may be the player that controls the vehicle that chooses which result to apply. When this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.

In some cases, all of the Location dice rolled may be applied. For example, if a vehicle has suffered several hits at once from a Rapid Fire (X) weapon, a number of Location dice equal to the number of Hits is rolled. Again, when this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.

### B. ROLL DAMAGE DICE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#b-roll-damage-dice)

After a vehicle has been wounded, a number of Damage dice equal to the Damage characteristic are rolled. Unlike when rolling Injury dice for a wounded fighter, this is done every time a vehicle is successfully wounded regardless of Hull Points remaining.

Regardless of how many Damage dice are rolled, only one result is applied against the vehicle for each hit suffered – the benefit of rolling extra dice is an increased chance of inflicting significant damage! If more than one Damage dice is rolled for a hit, one result is chosen and the others are discarded. When this is the case, it is usual for the player that made the roll to choose a single result to resolve and discard the other dice. Sometimes, however, it may be the player that controls the vehicle that chooses which result to apply. When this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.

In some cases, more than one of the Damage dice rolled for a single hit may be applied. When this is the case, the rules will always make it clear.

### DAMAGE DICE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#damage-dice)

Damage dice are special dice used to determine the severity of the damage caused to a vehicle. Each face is marked with one of three different symbols. These are:

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7b0e0e6-24b9-4da8-8ab2-a5c5242f7825/23f049ae-8e6d-4eca-9697-4a5b706121d8/Untitled.png)

## DAMAGE TABLES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#damage-tables)

Once the Damage dice have been rolled, look up on the following tables the effect of the chosen result(s) against the location hit. All damage effects applied are cumulative:

### BODY DAMAGE TABLE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#body-damage-table)

| Type of Hit | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Glancing Hit | Crew Shaken: The vehicle and any fighters on board become subject to the Concussion condition and the vehicle immediately makes a Handling test. If this test is failed, it becomes Stationary and Stalled. |
| Penetrating Hit | Structural Damage: The vehicle loses one Hull Point and immediately makes a Handling test. If this test is failed, it becomes Stationary and Stalled. |
| Catastrophic Hit | Weapon Destroyed: One of the vehicle’s weapons (chosen at random) is damaged and cannot be used for the remainder of this battle. In addition, the vehicle loses one Hull Point. If the vehicle has no undamaged weapons, it loses two Hull Points instead. Additionally, the vehicle immediately makes a https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests. |

### ENGINE DAMAGE TABLE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#engine-damage-table)

| Type of Hit | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Glancing Hit | Stutter: The vehicle immediately becomes Stationary and Stalled. |
| Penetrating Hit | Loss of Power: The vehicle loses one Hull Point and for the remainder of this battle it cannot move further than its Movement characteristic during its activation. Additionally, the vehicle immediately makes a https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests. |
| Catastrophic Hit | Belching Smoke & Flame: The vehicle loses two Hull Points and for the remainder of this battle it cannot move further than its Movement characteristic during its activation. Additionally, the vehicle immediately makes a Loss of Control test with a -1 modifier. |

### CREW DAMAGE TABLE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#crew-damage-table)

| Type of Hit | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Glancing Hit | Crew Shaken: The vehicle and any fighters on board become subject to the Concussion condition and the vehicle immediately makes a Handling test. If this test is failed, it becomes Stationary and Stalled. |
| Penetrating Hit | Driver Wounded: The driver suffers a Flesh Wound, causing the vehicle to reduce both its BS and Handling characteristics by 1. In any End phase in which the driver has one or more Flesh Wounds, roll a D6 during the Recover & Restart step: • On a 1, the driver succumbs to their wounds and passes out. Immediately apply a Driver Black Out result against this vehicle (see below). Do not roll to see if they recover from it this round.• On a 2 or 3, the driver grits their teeth and carries on driving through the pain.• On a 4+, the driver is able to patch up their wounds. Remove one Flesh Wound (and its effects) from the driver. |
| Catastrophic Hit | Driver Black Out: The driver briefly loses consciousness. The vehicle immediately loses control as if it had failed a https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests, changes its Status to Stationary and Stalled, and if it has a Ready marker remove it. Do not add a Ready marker to this vehicle during the Ready Models step until the driver regains consciousness. In any End phase where the driver has blacked out, roll a D6 during the Recover & Restart step:• On a 1-3, the driver remains unconscious.• On a 4+, the driver comes round, they then suffer a Driver Wounded result (see above). Do not roll to see if they recover from it this round. |

### DRIVE DAMAGE TABLE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#drive-damage-table)

| Type of Hit | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Glancing Hit | Tank Slapper: The vehicle immediately makes a https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests. |
| Penetrating Hit | Blow Out: The vehicle loses one Hull Point and for the remainder of this battle it suffers a -1 modifier to all Handling tests. Additionally, the vehicle immediately makes a Loss of Control test. |
| Catastrophic Hit | Major Malfunction: The vehicle loses two Hull Points and for the remainder of this battle it suffers a -2 modifier to all Handling tests. Additionally, the vehicle immediately makes a Loss of Control test. |

## WRECKED VEHICLES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#wrecked-vehicles)

When a vehicle is reduced to 0 Hull Points, or when a vehicle loses control and Rolls, that vehicle is Wrecked and will play no further part in the battle.

When this happens, players may wish to leave the model in place upon the battlefield, or they may wish to replace the model with a terrain feature representing a Wrecked vehicle of a similar size. Wrecked vehicles left in place in this way are treated as flimsy structures for the remainder of the battle. Alternatively, the model can simply be removed from play. In any case, the vehicle itself will suffer Lasting Damage, and any fighters aboard the vehicle will be Thrown Clear.

### THROWN CLEAR[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#thrown-clear)

When a vehicle is Wrecked, any fighters on board it are thrown clear. When a fighter is thrown clear, they are placed within 2" of the vehicle and must take an Initiative test. If this test is passed, the fighter remains Standing. If, however, this test is failed, the fighter becomes Prone and Pinned and suffers a Hit as if they had fallen from the vehicle (see [Falling](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits#falling)), increasing the Strength, AP and Damage of the hit by 1 if the vehicle was Mobile when Wrecked.

INFO

### VEHICLES WITH MULTIPLE CREW[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#vehicles-with-multiple-crew)

Vehicles may be crewed by many gangers, however, in the rules we treat all members of a vehicle’s crew, regardless of number, as a single entity.

### INJURED CREW[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#injured-crew)

Crew can be taken Out of Action just like any other fighter. If a vehicle is Wrecked, the crew is automatically taken Out of Action. However, when rolling for Lasting Injury for the crew, roll on the following table:

| D66 | Crew Injury |
| --- | --- |
| 11 | Lesson Learned: The crew goes into Convalescence but gains D3 Experience. |
| 12-26 | Out Cold: The crew misses the rest of the battle, but avoids any long term injuries. The crew recovers in time to perform post- battle actions. |
| 31-46 | Convalescence: The crew goes into Convalescence. |
| 51-52 | Humiliated: The crew goes into Convalescence. In addition, their Leadership and Cool characteristics are each decreased by 1. |
| 53-54 | Head Injury: The crew goes into Recovery. In addition, their Intelligence and Willpower characteristics are each decreased by 1. |
| 55-56 | Eye Injury: The crew goes into Recovery. In addition, their Ballistic Skill characteristic is decreased by 1. |
| 61-65 | Critical Injury: The crew is in a critical condition – if their injuries are not successfully treated by a visit to the Doc (see https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#medical-escort) in the post-battle sequence, they will die. |
| 66 | Memorable Death: The crew is killed instantly – not even the most talented Doc can save them. If the injury was caused by an Attack action, the attacker gains 1 additional XP. |

## LASTING DAMAGE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#lasting-damage)

Whenever a vehicle is Wrecked, the opposing player immediately rolls a D6 and looks up the result on the Lasting Damage table opposite. During Campaign play, all results are applied against the vehicle and a note of all Lasting Damage sustained made on the gang roster.

In some cases, a vehicle may become Wrecked in several ways at once (being reduced to 0 Hull Points before Rolling, for example). In such a case, a separate roll for each is made on the Lasting Damage table and each result is applied. Rolling for Lasting Damage must be done during Campaign play. Should players wish, they can forgo this step during Skirmish play.

### GOING INTO REPAIR[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#going-into-repair)

In some cases, a vehicle will become a Write-off. During Campaign play, this means that the vehicle is placed In Repair and cannot take part in any battles until it has been repaired (see [Negotiate Repairs](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#negotiate-repairs)).

The vehicle’s In Repair box on the gang roster is checked to indicate this. Once the vehicle is repaired, it becomes available again.

| D6 | Lasting Damage |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Persistent Rattle: There’s something not quite right. Apply a +1 modifier on any future Lasting Damage rolls made for this vehicle. |
| 2 | Handling Glitch: The vehicle suffers a -1 modifier to its Handling tests. |
| 3 | Unreliable: At the start of every battle, roll a D6 for each Unreliable Lasting Damage result this vehicle has sustained. If any of these rolls is a 1, the vehicle won’t start and cannot take part in the battle ahead. |
| 4 | Loss of Power: The vehicle’s Movement characteristic is reduced by 1". |
| 5 | Damaged Bodywork: Reduce each of the vehicle’s Toughness characteristics by 1. |
| 6 | Damaged Frame: Reduce the vehicle’s Hull Points characteristic by 1. |
| 7+ | Write-off: The vehicle is not currently roadworthy and cannot take part in any battles unless it is repaired (see https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#negotiate-repairs. |

## LOSS OF CONTROL TESTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#loss-of-control-tests)

Several of the vehicle damage effects, as well as some actions, require a player to make a Loss of Control test for the vehicle. This may be due to an impact with another vehicle or terrain, damage caused to the vehicle by enemy attacks, or even as a result of the driver falling unconscious at the controls due to injuries sustained. Whatever the case, failing a Loss of Control test can have dramatic results.

To make a Loss of Control test, make a Handling test for the vehicle, applying any modifiers as required:

- If the test is passed, the driver maintains control of the vehicle and nothing untoward happens.
- If the test is failed, the driver has lost control:
    - If the vehicle was Stationary, the force of the impact may turn the vehicle, causing it to pivot in place or, in extreme cases, to Roll.
    - If the vehicle was Mobile, the impact causes the vehicle to swerve dangerously and veer off course or, in extreme cases, to Roll.

### FIGHTERS ON VEHICLES LOSING CONTROL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#fighters-on-vehicles-losing-control)

If a vehicle Swerves or Jackknifes then any fighters on it, and not in designated transport areas, must [test to avoid falling](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/terrain#falling).

### LOSING CONTROL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#losing-control)

When a Loss of Control test is failed, the vehicle’s controlling player rolls a D6 and the Control dice:

- If a Swerve is rolled on the Control dice, the vehicle pivots around its central point 45°.
- If a Jackknife is rolled on the Control dice, the vehicle pivots around its central point 90°.
- If a Roll is rolled on the Control dice, the vehicle is flipped over by the force of the impact.

![SwerveDice](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7b0e0e6-24b9-4da8-8ab2-a5c5242f7825/579f9b1e-6f59-4bad-a6a0-6e192bc4eff1/Untitled.png)

![JackKnifeDice](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7b0e0e6-24b9-4da8-8ab2-a5c5242f7825/9c37f611-e87c-4278-a3f4-89f809470e7f/Untitled.png)

In the case of a Swerve or a Jackknife, the direction the vehicle turns is determined by the D6:

- On a 1-3, the vehicle turns left.
- On a 4-6, the vehicle turns right.

![Swerve](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7b0e0e6-24b9-4da8-8ab2-a5c5242f7825/776166f9-22d7-478a-b874-e55f89c9daa5/Untitled.png)

> *Here we see a vehicle pivoted 45° and 90° to the left around its central point.*

### SWERVING AND JACKKNIFING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#swerving-and-jackknifing)

If a Stationary vehicle Swerves or Jackknifes, it will simply pivot in place, as described above. However, if a Mobile vehicle Swerves or Jackknifes, it will pivot and then move a number of inches equal to half its Movement characteristic.

### ROLLING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#rolling)

If a Stationary vehicle Rolls, it will simply flip onto its side or roof in place, as described previously. However, if a Mobile vehicle Rolls, it will roll a number of times and move a number of inches in a random direction.

When a Mobile vehicle Rolls, the opposing player rolls a Scatter dice and a D3.

The Scatter dice determines the direction in which the vehicle moves as it Rolls. If a Hit is rolled, use the small arrow to determine direction.

The D3 determines how many times it rolls before coming to rest. The vehicle moves 2" in the direction determined by the Scatter dice for each roll it makes. During this movement, the vehicle is considered to be moving as if it were an active model, does not change facing and all vehicle impacts are resolved as [Head-on Collisions](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/vehicle-impacts#head-on-collisions). Note that the rolling vehicle takes no further damage.

Whatever the case, Rolling onto its side or roof is extremely detrimental to a vehicle and will render it immobile. A vehicle that Rolls is reduced to 0 Hull Points and is Wrecked. It will take no further part in the battle.

# THE END PHASE

*Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)*

After all models have been activated, the Action phase ends and play moves on to the End phase. The End phase has four steps:

1. **Bottle Checks:** If a player has at least one Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action fighter, or at least one Wrecked vehicle, they will have to make a Bottle check for their gang.
2. **Fleeing the Battlefield:** If either gang has failed a Bottle check, that gang’s controlling player makes a Cool test for each of their models that is still on the battlefield. Any models that fail will flee the battlefield.
3. **Recover & Restart:** Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players make Recovery tests for any Prone and Seriously Injured fighters and/or Restart tests for any Stationary and Stalled vehicles belonging to their gang.
4. **Rally Tests:** Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players make Cool tests for Broken models belonging to their gang to see if they can Rally.

NOTE

### REMOVE TEMPORARY EFFECTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#remove-temporary-effects)

**Smoke:** Roll a D6 per smoke cloud: on a 1-4 it is removed.

**Graviton Pulse:** Remove any Graviton Pulse blasts.

**Toxic Sludge:** Roll a 2+ for each Prone fighter that is at least partially in a pool of toxic sludge, or go Out of Action.

## 1. BOTTLE CHECKS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#1-bottle-checks)

At the start of the End phase, a player will be required to make a Bottle check for their gang if one or more of their fighters are currently either Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action, or if one or more of their vehicles is currently Wrecked. If both players are required to make a Bottle check, the player that holds Priority should go first.

To make a Bottle check for their gang, the controlling player rolls a D6 and adds to the result the total number of fighters belonging to their gang that are currently Prone and Seriously Injured or Out of Action and the total number of vehicles belonging to their gang that are currently Wrecked. If the final result is higher than the total number of models in its starting crew (the number of models that were present at the start of the battle, see [Choosing Crews](https://necrovox.org/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#choose-crew)), the Bottle check is failed and the gang has ‘bottled out’. If the scenario uses Reinforcements, instead of comparing to the number of models in its starting crew, compare the total to the number of models that were eligible to take part in the battle.

Note that once a gang has bottled out, there is no need to make any further Bottle check for it. It is considered to have bottled out for the remainder of the battle.

HOUSE RULE (A&A)

- Reinforcements count towards bottle tests.
- A voluntary fail automatically loses the match.

## 2. FLEEING THE BATTLEFIELD[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#2-fleeing-the-battlefield)

Once a gang has bottled out, both fighters and vehicles alike may begin to flee the battlefield. During this step of the End phase, starting with the gang that holds Priority if both gangs have bottled out, the controlling player makes a Cool test for each of their models that is currently on the battlefield:

- If the test is passed, the model holds its nerve and remains on the battlefield.
- If the test is failed, the model chooses discretion over valour and it (or in the case of a vehicle, its crew) flees the battlefield.

What happens to a model when it flees the battlefield will depend firstly upon whether it is a fighter or a vehicle and, secondly, upon its current Secondary Status:

1. Should a fighter flee the battlefield whilst their Secondary Status is Active, Engaged or Pinned, they are simply removed from play with no ill effect.
2. Should a fighter flee the battlefield whilst their Secondary Status is Seriously Injured, they are removed from play and set to one side. During the Wrap-up, test to see if they [succumb to their injuries](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#succumbing-to-injuries).
3. Should a vehicle flee the battlefield, the crew will abandon the vehicle and flee the battlefield, returning later to collect their vehicle. Change the vehicle’s Status to Stationary and Wrecked but do not roll on the Lasting Damage table.

### VOLUNTARILY FLEEING THE BATTLEFIELD[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#voluntarily-fleeing-the-battlefield)

In the tense gang combat of Necromunda, it is often wise for a gang to quit a fight while they are still ahead. This is especially true in ambushes, and when smaller crews find themselves taking on larger and more dangerous ones! Once at least one of a gang’s starting crew is Prone and Seriously Injured, taken Out of Action or are Wrecked, a gang’s controlling player can choose to automatically fail any Bottle check the gang is required to make.

Once a gang has bottled out (either voluntarily or by failing a Bottle check), the controlling player can declare that the gang will flee the battlefield at the start of any Action phase. Any Standing and Active or Prone and Pinned fighters, and all vehicles, immediately flee the battlefield as described above. Engaged fighters must attempt to break away from combat – make an Initiative test for each. If the test is passed, they flee the battlefield. If the test is failed, they become Prone and Seriously Injured. Once the gang that has declared that it will flee has only Prone and Seriously Injured fighters remaining on the battlefield, the battle ends. Roll to see if Prone and Seriously Injured fighters succumb to their injuries in the Wrap-up as usual.

### GANG HIERARCHY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#gang-hierarchy)

Some models, most notably Leaders and Champions, have a special rule called ‘Gang Hierarchy (X)’ listed on their profile. In all such cases, the ‘X’ in brackets will be replaced by the model’s rank (‘Leader’ or ‘Champion’):

**Gang Hierarchy (X):** During a battle, once this model’s gang has failed a Bottle check, during any End phase in which this model passes its Cool test and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly models that are within 12" (if this model is a Leader) or 6" (if this model is a Champion) of this model will automatically pass their Cool test and will not flee the battlefield.

## 3. RECOVER & RESTART[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#3-recover--restart)

Starting with the player that holds Priority, both players make Recovery tests for any Prone and Seriously Injured fighters belonging to their gang to see if they recover sufficiently to return to the fight. Similarly, both players make Restart tests for any Stationary and Stalled vehicles belonging to their gang to see if they can be restarted and become Mobile once again.

### RECOVERY TESTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#recovery-tests)

For each member of their gang that is Prone and Seriously Injured and still on the battlefield, the controlling player makes a Recovery test by rolling an Injury dice:

- If the result is Out of Action, the fighter is removed from play.
- If the result is Seriously Injured, the fighter suffers a Flesh Wound and remains as they are – Prone and Seriously Injured.
- If the result is a Flesh Wound, the fighter suffers a Flesh Wound and becomes Prone and Pinned.

**Assistance:** When making a Recovery test for a Prone and Seriously Injured fighter, one Standing and Active friendly fighter that is within 1" can offer assistance. If they do so, roll one extra Injury dice then pick one of the Injury dice to resolve and discard the other. In addition, a fighter that is being assisted does not suffer a Flesh Wound regardless of the result of the Injury dice.

A fighter can only assist one Recovery test per End phase.

**Multiple Injury Dice:** It may happen that, due to assistance, items of Wargear, Tactics cards or skills that, when making a Recovery test, several Injury dice are rolled. Regardless of how many are rolled, one Injury dice is picked and resolved – the others are discarded, as described previously.

### RESTART TESTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#restart-tests)

For each vehicle belonging to their gang that is currently Stationary and Stalled, the controlling player makes a Restart test. To make a Restart test, make a Handling test for the vehicle, applying a +1 modifier unless the vehicle has only 1 HP remaining:

1. If the Handling test is passed, the vehicle immediately Restarts, changing its Status from Stationary and Stalled to Mobile.
2. If the Handling test is failed, the vehicle refuses to Restart and it remains Stationary and Stalled.

### WOUNDED DRIVERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#wounded-drivers)

Finally during this step, if any vehicles in a player’s gang have suffered a Driver Wounded damage effect, a D6 is rolled for that driver, as described in [Crew Damage Table: Drive Wounded](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#crew-damage-table).

## 4. RALLY TESTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-end-phase#4-rally-tests)

During the final step of the End phase, players may attempt to Rally any Broken models belonging to their gang, starting with the gang that holds Priority if both gangs contain Broken models.

To Rally a Broken model, make a Cool test for them, applying a +1 modifier to the result for each friendly model within 3" of them that is not Broken and is not Prone and Seriously Injured:

- If the test is passed, the model is no longer Broken.
- If the test is failed, the model remains Broken and may attempt to Rally again in the next End phase.

FLOODED PASSAGE (SPECIAL TERRAIN FEATURE)

At the end of each End phase, roll 2+ for each Seriously Injured fighter in the Flood Water or they are taken Out of Action (their injuries are too great to keep their head above water).

BADZONE ENVIRONMENTS

If using Badzone Environments, roll to see if the current is discarded. If discarded, generate a new Event.

NOTE

Leading by Example is not affected by any status or condition (Broken, Seriously Injured, Blaze etc.)

# THE POST-BATTLE SEQUENCE

Following any battle, there are several important steps that need to take place, as listed below. Some of these only apply during Campaign play, and can therefore be skipped during Skirmish play, as mentioned in the appropriate entries. Whatever the case, this sequence must be followed in the order shown, and must be done while both players are present.

The post-battle sequence has seven steps:

1. Wrap-up
2. Assign/Reassign Territory
3. Receive Rewards
4. Collect Income
5. Post-battle Actions
6. Update Roster
7. Report Results

## 1. WRAP-UP[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#1-wrap-up)

During the Wrap-up, each player checks to see whether any fighters that were Prone and Seriously Injured when the battle ended, or that fled from the battlefield whilst Prone and Seriously Injured, succumb to their injuries, as described as follows. Additionally, during the Wrap-up players determine whether any fighters captured by the enemy manage to escape, as described as follows, after which any vehicles that were abandoned by fleeing crew (as described as follows) are retrieved.

Finally, during a battle fought as part of a campaign, it is at the end of the Wrap-up that fighters that were In Recovery are considered to have made a full recovery, and their In Recovery box on the gang roster is cleared.

Players should note that any other events that take place ‘at the end of the battle’ will also take place during the Wrap-up.

### SUCCUMBING TO INJURIES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#succumbing-to-injuries)

If a fighter is Prone and Seriously Injured when the battle ends, or if a fighter belonging to a gang that had bottled out fled from the battlefield whilst Prone and Seriously Injured, roll a D6 for them during the Wrapup. On a 3 or more, they survive without any further complications, but on a 1 or 2 they succumb to the injuries suffered during the battle and are treated as having gone Out of Action. A Lasting Injury roll is made for them, as described previously.

### BEING CAPTURED[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#being-captured)

After the battle there is a chance that any fighters who have been captured by the opposing gang may be able to slip away while being taken away:

**Capturing Enemy Fighters:** Roll a D6 for each friendly fighter that suffered a Captured result (55-56) on the Lasting Injury chart and apply the below modifiers:

- 1 if the battle was a draw.
- 2 if the fighter’s gang lost the battle.
- 2 if the fighter was taken Out of Action while subject to the Webbed condition.

If the result is 4+ then the fighter successfully escapes their bonds before being dragged away and goes into Convalescence (a natural roll of a 6 always results in the captive escaping). Otherwise the fighter has been Captured – make a note in the Lasting Injury/Captured By box on the gang roster for the Captured fighter, recording the name of the gang who has Captured the fighter.

### CLAIMING SCRAP[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#claiming-scrap)

If only one gang has models left on the battlefield at the start of the Wrap-up, they will grab what they can from Wrecked enemy vehicles before leaving the battlefield. That gang adds D3x10 credits to their Stash for each Wrecked enemy vehicle on the battlefield. The Wrecked vehicles are then reclaimed by their gang.

### CAPTIVE FIGHTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters)

Whilst a fighter is Captured, they are said to be a ‘Captive’. That fighter is unavailable for battles and post-battle actions as if they were In Recovery. This lasts until that fighter is recovered (as follows), rather than for just one battle. The Capturing gang should make a note in their Stash of the fighter they now hold Captive.

When a fighter is Captured, their gang has a chance to rescue them. The Captured fighter’s controlling player may issue a challenge to the gang that holds their fighter Captive to play a Rescue Mission. This supersedes the usual challenge process and the [Determine Scenario step](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-pre-battle-sequence#3-determine-scenario) of the pre-battle sequence – instead, the Rescue Mission scenario is played.

If a gang does not wish to attempt to rescue a Captive, or if the rescue attempt fails:

- A Law Abiding gang may claim a bounty on a [Captive fighter](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters) belonging to an Outlaw gang during the post-battle sequence of that battle.
- An Outlaw gang may ‘dispose’ of a Captive fighter belonging to any gang during the post-battle sequence of that battle.
- Any gang may trade a Captive back to the gang it belongs to or to any other gang that wants the Captive, as described as follows.
- Any gang may [sell a Captive to the Guilders](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#sell-to-the-guilders) as a slave during the post-battle sequence of that battle.

If the Captive is still held the next time the two gangs face each other, the controlling player of the gang the Captive belongs to once again has the option to declare that their gang will attempt a Rescue Mission.

### TRADING CAPTIVE MODELS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#trading-captive-models)

At any time during a campaign, regardless of whether a Rescue Mission has been attempted, the two gangs’ controlling players can come to an agreement to make a trade to secure a Captive’s return. Additionally, once a Rescue Mission has been attempted and failed, the gang that holds the Captive is free to trade it to any gang they wish.

This trade could be a payment of credits, a trade for another Captive, a valuable item of equipment, even surrendering a Territory, or anything else – it is entirely up to the two players to decide and either gang is free to decline an offer made by the other. If an agreement is reached, the Captive is transferred to the gang that the trade was made with. If the Captive is returned through a trade to the gang it belongs to, they immediately become available to the gang once more.

## 2. ASSIGN/REASSIGN TERRITORY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#2-assignreassign-territory)

The player that won the battle takes control of the Territory staked on the battle. In the case of a draw while fighting for control of an uncontrolled Territory, the Territory is not claimed by either player. In the case of a draw during the Takeover phase when a controlled Territory is at stake, the Territory does not change hands.

## 3. RECEIVE REWARDS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#3-receive-rewards)

Each scenario shows a list of rewards which the gangs can receive, based on their performance during the battle. Any equipment gained is added to the gang’s Stash – it can be distributed to fighters in step 6.

HOUSE RULE (A&A)

Scenario Rewards are capped at 4D6 (x10 Credits). this means you cannot roll more than 4 D6 dice when determining your rewards, rather than making a separate roll to determine your reward cap.

### GAINING AND LOSING REPUTATION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#gaining-and-losing-reputation)

Most scenarios contain a number of ways in which a gang can gain or lose Reputation. If a gang both gains and loses Reputation, any gains are applied before any losses.

## 4. COLLECT INCOME[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#4-collect-income)

Each gang collects income from each Territory they control that generates income, as detailed for that Territory. The total amount of credits generated from each gang’s Territories is then added to the gang’s Stash.

## 5. POST-BATTLE ACTIONS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#5-post-battle-actions)

During a campaign, each fighter in the gang that has the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule can make one post-battle action. Each of these actions is carried out one at a time, in an order of the controlling player’s choice. Fighters who are In Recovery, or who have been Captured, cannot make post-battle actions. Unless otherwise stated, the same action can be made more than once. The actions below are always available, but others might also become available through special Territories, skills or other means.

### TRADE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#trade)

The fighter can visit the Trading Post by making a Trade action – this action is resolved during the [Visit the Trading Post step](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post) of the post-battle sequence. The availability of Rare and Illegal items available at the Trading Post is influenced by whether it is a Law-abiding or Outlaw gang visiting.

### SELL TO THE GUILDERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#sell-to-the-guilders)

The fighter can sell any number of Captive fighters to the Guilders – as long as the Captive’s gang has had a [chance to rescue them](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters):

Each Captive fighter is worth half of their total Cost (50%) when sold as a slave (including all weapons and Wargear), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits – add these credits to this gang’s Stash. The Captive fighter’s controlling player should be informed as soon as possible, and must delete the Captive fighter fromtheir roster. All weapons and equipment owned by the fighter are sold along with them, they do not go into any gang’s Stash.

### CLAIM BOUNTIES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#claim-bounties)

Law Abiding gangs can [claim bounties](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#claim-bounties) for any enemy fighters belonging to Outlaw gangs that they have Captured (providing the Captive’s controlling player has had the opportunity to attempt a Rescue Mission, as described in [Captive Fighters](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters)). The bounty for a Captive fighter is equal to that fighter’s full Cost – this many credits are added to this gang’s Stash. The Captive fighter’s controlling player should be informed as soon as possible, and must delete the Captive from their roster

### ‘DISPOSE’ OF CAPTIVES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#dispose-of-captives)

As described in [Captive Fighters](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#captive-fighters), Outlaw gangs can dispose of any enemy fighters they have captured, providing the Captive’s controlling player has had the opportunity to attempt a Rescue Mission. How the fighter is disposed of varies depending upon the type of gang in question. Some captives are sacrificed in dark rituals, others are eaten, and yet more simply disappear. Whatever the case, the Captive’s controlling player should be informed as soon as possible that their fighter has been disposed of, and must delete that fighter from their roster.

### MEDICAL ESCORT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#medical-escort)

The fighter escorts a critically injured fellow gang member to the Doc. Select one other fighter or crew in the gang that suffered a Critical Injury during the battle and pay 2D6x10 credits from the gang’s Stash. If the gang does not have sufficient funds, or does not wish to pay the full amount, no roll is made and the fighter or crew dies. Otherwise, roll a D6 on the table below:

| D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Complications: The fighter dies. |
| 2-5 | Stabilised: Roll on the Lasting Injury table, re-rolling any results of Captured, Critical Injury or Memorable Death. Apply the result, in addition the fighter goes into Recovery. |
| 6 | Full Recovery: The fighter goes into Recovery, but suffers no lasting effects. |

### NEGOTIATE REPAIRS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#negotiate-repairs)

The fighter accompanies the crew of a vehicle that has suffered Lasting Damage to the Chop Shop. Select one vehicle in the gang that has sustained Lasting Damage and roll a D6 on the table below to determine the cost of repairs. If the gang wishes to meet this cost, it pays with credits from its Stash and all Lasting Damage previously sustained is removed from the vehicle. If the gang does not have sufficient funds, or does not wish to pay the amount, the vehicle is not repaired and the Lasting Damage it has sustained is not removed:

| D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1-3 | Almost Like New: The repairs cost a quarter (25%), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits, of the vehicle’s Cost (including Upgrades but not including Wargear and weapons), but the vehicle isn’t quite the same. Replace all Lasting Damage the vehicle has previously sustained with a Persistent Rattle. |
| 4-5 | Quality Repairs: The repairs cost a quarter (25%), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits, of the vehicle’s Cost (including Upgrades but not including Wargear and weapons). |
| 6 | Superficial Damage: The repairs cost a tenth (10%), rounding up to the nearest 5 credits, of the vehicle’s Cost (including Upgrades but not including Wargear and weapons). |

## 6. UPDATE ROSTER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#6-update-roster)

During this step of the post-battle sequence, gangs can dispose of dead and injured fighters, scrap damaged vehicles, purchase new equipment and models, and more. During this step, players should follow this sequence:

A. Clean House

B. Visit the Trading Post

C. Gain Boons from Territories

D. Distribute Equipment

E. Purchase Advancements

F. Update Gang Rating

### A. CLEAN HOUSE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#a-clean-house)

After any battle, a gang is likely to have dead fighters to dispose of, injured fighters to retire, and wrecked vehicles to sell for scrap. This process is generally referred to as ‘cleaning house’.

Dead fighters or vehicle crew are simply deleted from the roster. If their gang had at least one fighter on the battlefield at the end of the battle, or if the fighter was taken to the Doc but still died, all of their equipment (except for armour) is added to the gang’s Stash. Otherwise, the dead fighter’s equipment is lost. If they were crew, their vehicle is added to the gang’s Stash and can be given to a new crew.

Also at this point, the controlling player can choose to retire fighters or vehicle crews – usually because Lasting Injuries have rendered them unfit for battle. These fighters are deleted from the roster, and their equipment is added to the gang’s Stash. Equipment in the gang’s Stash can be sold or transferred to a new fighter in the next step. If they were crew, their vehicle is added to the gang’s Stash and can be given to a new crew.

Finally, the controlling player can choose to scrap any vehicles that have sustained Lasting Damage. A vehicle is worth a quarter of its total Cost (25%) rounded up to the nearest 5 credits (including Upgrades but not including Wargear and weapons) when sold as scrap. These credits are added to the gang’s Stash. When a vehicle is scrapped, any Upgrades it had are lost, though its Wargear and weapons are added to the gang’s Stash. The crew must be either given a new vehicle, one must be purchased for them or they are retired.

### B. VISIT THE TRADING POST[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#b-visit-the-trading-post)

The gang can visit the Trading Post to spend its hardearned credits in any of the ways described below, allowing them to hire new fighters and buy or sell equipment. The actions can be made in any order and, unless specified, there is no limit to how many times a gang can perform each one. Any spent credits are deducted from the gang’s Stash; any gained credits are added to the gang’s Stash.

**Hire a Fighter:** The gang can hire a new fighter or crew from its House List, paying for them as they did when founding the gang. No equipment is purchased for this fighter or crew – they receive equipment in a later step.

Note that, when hiring new fighters or crew, the Gang Composition rules and any restrictions detailed in the gang list must be honoured.

**Purchase a Vehicle:** The gang can purchase any new vehicle from its House List, paying for it as they did when founding the gang. No Upgrades are purchased for this vehicle – it receives Upgrades in a later step.

**Recruit Hangers-on & Brutes:** The gang can spend credits to add a Hanger-on or a Brute to their roster. Their Reputation must be sufficient to allow this.

**Sell Unwanted Items:** Any items in the gang’s Stash can be sold. The item is deleted from the Stash, and the gang gains its value in credits, minus D6x10 (to a minimum of 5 credits).

Note that equipment granted as a Territory Boon cannot be sold during the same post-battle sequence.

**Purchase Equipment:** Equipment can be purchased for any model from its own Equipment List at the price shown (this cannot be added to the gang’s Stash during this post-battle sequence). A gang can purchase Common equipment from the Trading Post, at the price shown, adding it to its Stash. This action cannot be used to purchase Rare or Illegal equipment.

**Seek Rare & Illegal Equipment (Trade Post-battle Action Only):** This action can only be performed if a fighter has made a Trade post-battle action, is only performed once and is done to determine the availability of Rare and Illegal items on offer at the [Trading Post](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/). Roll 2D6 to determine the availability of items, adding the following bonuses:

- +2 if the gang’s Leader is making a Trade post- battle action.
- +1 for each Champion making a Trade post- battle action.
- +1 for every full 10 Reputation the gang has.
- +/-X as from a specified special rule.
    - A Law-abiding gang may purchase equipment from the Trading Post that is Rare (X) where X is equal to or less than the Availability level and may purchase items that are Illegal (X) where X is equal to or less than the Availability level -4.
    - An Outlaw gang may purchase equipment from the Trading Post that is Rare (X) or Illegal (X) where X is equal to or less than the Availability level.

Note that Exclusive items may not be purchased from the Trading Post, only from gang Equipment Lists.

### THE BLACK MARKET, RARITY AND LEGALITY RATINGS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#the-black-market-rarity-and-legality-ratings)

Older publications may reference the Black Market, treat any of those abilities as referencing the Trading Post instead. Additionally, they may reference Rarity or Legality ratings – in these cases replace them with Rare (X) and Illegal (X). For example, a Rarity rating of 8 becomes Rare (8).

INFO

### POST-BATTLE ACTIONS TIMINGS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#post-battle-actions-timings)

Much as players may wish otherwise, sometimes there isn’t always time after a battle to fully resolve all the post-battle actions – when this occurs there are a couple of different options. Some players like to roll everything in front of their opponent and then go away and decide exactly how to spend their credits and XP, while others prefer to resolve all these in the pre-battle sequence of their next battle.

In the end, these options all work as long as both players and the Arbitrator (in Campaign play) agree.

### C. GAIN BOONS FROM TERRITORIES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#c-gain-boons-from-territories)

Some Territories grant a gang Boons in the form of additional recruits, Hangers-on or equipment. Any available Boons the gang wishes to claim are claimed now.

### D. DISTRIBUTE EQUIPMENT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#d-distribute-equipment)

Any equipment currently held in the gang’s Stash can now be distributed among its models. Weapon choices must respect any restrictions noted in a model’s entry within their gang list. Also, the limit of no more than three weapons for fighters must be adhered to, with weapons marked with a * taking the space of two.

Once any equipment has been added to a Fighter card or Vehicle card, the card’s Credits cost is updated accordingly. If the model is equipped with an item that has two different costs – one in the model’s own Equipment List and the other in the Trading Post – the value in the model’s own Equipment List takes precedence.

Players are reminded that no fighter can discard a weapon or Wargear that grants the [Mounted condition](https://necrovox.org/docs/general-principles/conditions#mounted) once added to their Fighter cards. Remember as well that fighters with the Tools of the Trade special rule can have multiple Fighter cards, each representing a different set of equipment, as described on [Equipment Sets](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#equipment-sets).

### E. PURCHASE ADVANCEMENTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#e-purchase-advancements)

In Campaign play, each player can use this step of the post-battle sequence to spend Experience (XP), allowing their fighters to purchase [Advancements](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#advancements).

### F. UPDATE GANG RATING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#f-update-gang-rating)

Re-calculate the gang’s Gang Rating, and update the roster accordingly. Note that this is not done until this step of the post-battle sequence, meaning that any other references to the Gang Rating in the post-battle sequence are referring to the Gang Rating prior to this step.

## 7. REPORT RESULTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#7-report-results)

Finally, the players should report the outcome of the battle to the Arbitrator of their campaign, who will update the campaign stats accordingly. The report should contain: which gangs fought, the outcome of the battle (i.e., who won), which Territory the victor gained control of, how many enemies each gang took Out of Action and the final Gang Rating and Wealth of the gangs.

# GAINING EXPERIENCE

*Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)*

During any battle, a fighter (including vehicle crew) can gain Experience (XP) in a number of ways. The standard ways in which Experience is gained are detailed here. Experience is also gained by completing scenario objectives – these will be detailed in the scenario. Players should note that, for the purposes of gaining Experience, vehicle crew are considered to be fighters.

A model gains XP for any of the following actions:

- 1 XP if their action directly causes an enemy fighter to suffer one or more Serious Injuries.*
- 2 XP if their action causes an enemy vehicle to become Wrecked.
- 2 XP if their action directly causes an enemy fighter to go Out of Action.*
- If the enemy fighter is a Leader or a Champion, gain an extra 1 XP.
- 1 XP if they took part in a battle (this XP is only gained if the scenario does not grant XP for a model taking part in the battle).
- 1 XP if they are Broken and successfully rally.
- 1 XP if they provide Assistance to another fighter making a Recovery test who becomes Prone and Pinned.
- *Note that fighters can only gain XP for Seriously Injuring or taking an enemy fighter Out of Action once per enemy fighter per activation. For instance, if a fighter causes an enemy fighter to suffer a Serious Injury, and then performs a Coup De Grace (Free) action, they would only gain the 2 XP for causing the enemy fighter to go Out of Action.*

HOUSE RULE (A&A)

Additonal ways to earn XP:

- D3 XP for the MVP of each playing team. This is nominated by your opponent at the end of the match.
- D3 XP for each fully painted model. This is awarded at the start of the campaign (or when they join your gang). If a model is unpainted, it gains the D3XP when it becomes painted.
- +1 additional XP when taking a Brute Out of Action.

## ADVANCEMENTS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#advancements)

At the end of a battle, during the post-battle sequence, each player has the chance to purchase Advancements for any of their models by spending some or all of the XP that model has accrued. The XP cost of these Advancements is shown on the following tables. The model’s card is updated accordingly with the Advancement taken, the model’s XP is reduced by the amount spent to purchase the Advancement, the model’s total number of Advancements is increased by one (on the gang roster) and the model’s Cost is adjusted by the amount of credits shown, which will in turn increase the Gang Rating.

The more experienced a model is, the more certain Advancements cost to purchase in terms of XP. The cost of each characteristic Advancement for the same characteristic taken is increased by 2 XP for each instance after the first. For example, a Champion may increase their Initiative by 1 for 5 XP, but to increase it by 1 a second time will cost them 7 XP. Juves and Prospects however are particularly fast learners, and as a result they suffer no such penalty on characteristic increases; they may increase a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum – see [Fighter Profiles](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/fighter-profiles#fighter-characteristics-profiles)) for the basic XP cost shown each time.

| Cost | Advancement (Leaders, Champions, Crews, Prospects, Juves & Specialists) | Cost Increase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 XP | Improve the fighter’s Willpower or Intelligence characteristic by 1. | +5 credits |
| 4 XP | Improve the fighter’s Leadership or Cool characteristic by 1. | +10 credits |
| 5 XP | Improve the fighter’s Initiative characteristic by 1. | +10 credits |
| 5 XP | Add 1" to the fighter’s Movement characteristic. | +10 credits |
| 6 XP | Improve the fighter’s Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill characteristic by 1. | +20 credits |
| 6 XP | The fighter gains a random skill from one of their Primary Skill Sets. | +20 credits |
| 8 XP | Increase the fighter’s Strength or Toughness characteristic by 1. | +30 credits |
| 9 XP | The fighter gains a skill of your choice from one of their Primary Skill Sets. | +20 credits |
| 9 XP | The fighter gains a random skill from one of their Secondary Skill Sets. | +35 credits |
| 12 XP | Increase the fighter’s Wounds or Attacks characteristic by 1. | +45 credits |
| 12 XP | Specialists only: Promote the fighter to a Champion. They gain a random skill from one of their Primary Skill Sets. | +40 credits |
| 12 XP | The fighter gains a skill of your choice from one of their Secondary Skill Sets. | +35 credits |
| 15 XP | The fighter gains a random skill from ANY Skill Set. | +50 credits |

### GANGERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#gangers)

Whilst Leaders, Champions, Prospects, Juves and Specialists are central to a gang’s narrative, Gangers are its ‘supporting cast’. As such, they spend Experience and gain Advancements in a simplified manner.

If during the post-battle sequence a Ganger has 6 XP or more, the controlling player must roll 2D6 on the table below, and then update the Ganger’s Fighter card and their Cost accordingly, before finally reducing their XP by 6.

| 2D6 | Advancement (Gangers, not including Specialists) | Cost Increase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | The fighter becomes a Specialist and gains a random skill from one of their Primary Skill Sets. | +20 credits |
| 3-4 | Improve the fighter’s Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill characteristic by 1. | +20 credits |
| 5-6 | Increase the fighter’s Strength or Toughness characteristic by 1. | +30 credits |
| 7 | Either add 1" to the fighter’s Movement characteristic, or increase their Initiative characteristic by 1. | +10 credits |
| 8-9 | Improve the fighter’s Willpower or Intelligence characteristic by 1. | +5 credits |
| 10-11 | Improve the fighter’s Leadership or Cool characteristic by 1. | +10 credits |
| 12 | The fighter becomes a Specialist and gains a random skill from one of their Primary Skill Sets. | +20 credits |

**Specialists:** Two of the results on the table above allow a Ganger to become a Specialist. They are still a Ganger, but from now on gain all the benefits of being a Specialist, as described in their entry in their Gang list.

## MAXIMUM CHARACTERISTICS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#maximum-characteristics)

As mentioned in [Fighter Profiles](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/fighter-profiles#fighter-characteristics-profiles), each of a fighter’s characteristics has a maximum value. In addition to these maximums, no fighter may improve their Movement, Strength or Toughness characteristics more than twice beyond that given in the basic profile for a fighter of their current category. No fighter may improve their Wounds or Attacks characteristics more than once beyond that given in the basic profile for a fighter of their current category.

If a roll on the Advancement table for a Ganger has no option but to increase a characteristic beyond its maximum, treat it as a roll of 12 instead.

YAQ

The fighter keeps improved stats above the new class maximum characteristics (for example Movement). However, if the fighter (after promotion) later receives stat decrease injury bringing them back to the current class max, the fighter will forever be unable to go above the max again (with future advancements or bionics).

## SKILLS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#skills)

Skills can be obtained by Leaders, Champions, Prospects, Juves, crews and Specialists. The skills that are available are divided into a number of universal [Skill Sets](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills). In addition, most gangs have their own unique Skill Set that represents the unique character of that gang or the House to which it belongs. These Skill Sets are presented alongside that Gang list.

Each gang fights in its own way, and this is reflected by the Skill Sets that are available to the fighters that make up that gang. All fighters have different levels of skill access depending upon their type and the gang to which they belong; for example, a House Goliath Forge Boss (Champion) can gain Brawn skills more easily than a House Escher Little Sister (Juve). In each Gang list, and for certain other types of fighter (Exotic Beasts and Brutes, for example), details are given showing the Skill Sets available to those fighters. Fighters have Primary access to some Skill Sets, and Secondary access to others. Certain fighters can access skills from other sets, but to do so is more expensive in terms of XP.

### GAINING A NEW SKILL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#gaining-a-new-skill)

Whenever a fighter gains a new skill, it will either be chosen by the controlling player or determined randomly. How a new skill is determined will depend upon how much XP has been spent to gain the skill or if the skill is Primary, Secondary or neither, as detailed in the [Advancements table](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/gaining-experience#advancements).

**Choosing a Skill:** Choosing a skill is a simple matter of selecting a desirable skill from one of the Skill Sets available to that fighter.

**Gaining a Random Skill:** Every skill in each Skill Set is numbered between 1 and 6. When a fighter gains a random skill, the player chooses a Skill Set to generate that skill from and rolls a D6. This roll determines which skill from the chosen Skill Set the fighter gains. If the fighter already has that skill, or cannot take that skill, simply re-roll the D6 until a skill the fighter does not have or can take is rolled.

## USING WYRD POWERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#using-wyrd-powers)

When a psyker makes a Wyrd Power (X) action, they must make a Willpower test to see if the action is successful. If the test is passed, the Wyrd Power takes immediate effect. If it is failed, the Wyrd Power has no effect and the action is wasted.

Some Wyrd Power (X) actions are noted as being a Continuous Effect. Such a power lasts from when the psyker performs the action until the end of their next activation when it will expire, unless they perform a Maintain Control (Simple) action during their activation, in which case the Continuous Effect remains in play for another round. A psyker can only ever have one Continuous Effect in play. If a psyker is Prone and Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action, any of their Continuous Effects will immediately expire.

However, using Wyrd Powers is not without risk. If the Willpower test is failed on the roll of a double 1, the psyker must immediately roll on the [Perils of the Warp table](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#perils-of-the-warp). If the Willpower test is passed on the roll of a double 6, the Wyrd Power takes effect, cannot be Disrupted (see [Psychic Duels](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#psychic-duels)) and the psyker must immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.

## PSYCHIC DUELS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#psychic-duels)

Whenever a psyker is activated to make a Wyrd Power (X) action or to make a Maintain Control (Simple) action, if there is a Standing and Active or Prone and Pinned enemy psyker within 18", they may attempt to Disrupt the psyker’s successful Wyrd Power.

To Disrupt a successful Wyrd Power (X) action, a psyker must roll 2D6. If the total is higher than the total rolled for the Willpower test made to successfully perform the action, the Wyrd Power is Disrupted and fails as if the psyker making the action had failed their own Willpower test. If the total is equal to or lower than the total of the Willpower test made to successfully perform the action, the Disruption attempt fails and the Wyrd Power (X) action is resolved.

However, Disruption attempts can be just as risky as manifesting psychic powers. If a double 6 is rolled, the Wyrd Power is cancelled, but the psyker making the Disruption attempt must immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table. If a double 1 is rolled, the Disruption attempt fails and the psyker making the Disruption attempt must immediately roll on the Perils of the Warp table.

## PERILS OF THE WARP[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#perils-of-the-warp)

Whenever a psyker rolls a double 1 or a double 6 when making a Willpower test to perform a Wyrd Power (X) action, or when attempting to Disrupt a Wyrd Power, roll 2D6 and consult the table below:

| 2D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 2-3 | A Tear in Reality!: The psyker loses control and warp energy tears reality apart around them. Centre a 5" Blast marker on the psyker; any model touched by the marker must pass a Willpower test or lose a Wound or suffer the https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/resolve-hits-against-vehicles#crew-damage-table. The psyker then goes Out of Action. |
| 4-5 | Immaterium Inverse: The Warp inverts upon those attempting to control it. The psyker becomes the target of the power (regardless of range). If the power is beneficial, the psyker instead becomes Prone and Pinned and suffers a Strength 6 hit that inflicts 2 Damage, ignoring armour saves, and the power has no other effects. |
| 6-8 | Whispers from the Warp: The psyker’s mind is filled with screaming daemonic voices. The psyker becomes subject to the Insane condition. Place an Insanity marker on the psyker’s Fighter card and roll a D6 on the https://necrovox.org/docs/general-principles/conditions#insane when they activate. |
| 9-10 | Warp Surge!: The psyker’s power becomes overcharged with warp energy. The psyker may immediately try to manifest the same power again as a free action, or, if they were trying to Disrupt a power, they may immediately manifest one of their own powers as a free action – this additional manifestation of the power can trigger Perils of the Warp as normal. After working out the effects of the power, the psyker becomes Prone and Pinned and suffers a Strength 4 hit which inflicts 1 Damage, ignoring armour saves. |
| 11-12 | Daemonic Possession: Daemonic energy courses through the psyker’s body. The psyker increases their Movement, Strength, Toughness and Attacks characteristics all by 3 and their Weapon Skill to 2+. Their unarmed attacks inflict 2 Damage and have an AP of -1. In the End phase of the following round, or if the psyker generates this result again, they go Out of Action. |

HOUSE RULE

### WHISPER OF THE WARP (NECRODAMUS, A&A)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#whisper-of-the-warp-necrodamus-aa)

If the first action causes Insanity, apply Insanity immediately if the fighter makes a 2nd action.

## SANCTIONED AND NON-SANCTIONED PSYKERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#sanctioned-and-non-sanctioned-psykers)

All psykers fall into two broad types, regardless of the powers they wield or where they originate from: sanctioned psykers and non-sanctioned psykers. Bearing the official approval of Imperial authorities, sanctioned psykers wield their powers under the control and vigilance of overseers and handlers. Trained from an early age in the correct use of their abilities and to minimise the risks of daemonic possession, sanctioned psykers are free to operate as they wish without the risk of censure by the authorities. A non-sanctioned psyker, by contrast, exists outside of the system and in secret, unaware of the great risks they present to themselves and others, and oblivious to the great efforts the Imperium goes to in controlling their kind. The rewards for bringing a non-sanctioned psyker to Imperial justice can be great, often significant enough to justify the risks of going against them!

To reflect their sanctioned or unsanctioned status, all psykers will have one of the two following skills on their profile:

**Sanctioned Psyker:** A psyker with this skill may re-roll a failed Willpower test once per battle.

**Non-sanctioned Psykers:** Should a psyker with this skill be taken Out of Action, the enemy gang is rewarded a bounty of D3x10 credits at the end of the battle. Should a psyker with this skill be captured and sold to the Guilders, they are worth their full value. Note that when a psyker with this skill is captured, they can be sold immediately without the opportunity for a Rescue Mission.

INFO

## WYRD POWERS AND THE FIREPOWER DICE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#wyrd-powers-and-the-firepower-dice)

Some Wyrd powers act as weapons that can be used by the psyker, however these powers can never run Out of Ammo. Therefore there is no need to roll a Firepower dice when attacking with a Wyrd power unless the attack has a Trait that triggers certain results on the Firepower dice.

## WYRD POWERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#wyrd-powers)

There are many ways that a fighter may gain access to Wyrd Powers – one of the most common being the use of Ghast. Presented below are a selection of Wyrd Powers for players and Arbitrators to use in their campaigns. If a fighter gains a Wyrd Power, they may either roll a D6 to see which power they gain or in some cases may choose one of the following powers.

TIP

Below you will find the Wyrd Powers listed in the 2023 Core Rules. These were greatly expanded upon in the Book of the Outcast and can be found in [Wyrd Powers](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers). Most campaigns will use the extended powers list, but check with your arbitrator if uncertain.

### 1. TELEKINESIS – ASSAIL (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#1-telekinesis--assail-basic)

*With a grunt, the wyrd pushes a person or an object away.*

Target a single enemy fighter or obstacle that is both within 12" and line of sight of this fighter and make a hit roll, using this fighter’s Ballistic Skill. If a hit is scored, move the target D3" in any direction – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a S3, AP -, D1 hit. If they come into base contact with another Standing fighter, that fighter also suffers a S3, AP -, D1 hit and becomes Prone and Pinned.

### 2. PYROMANCY – FLAME BLAST (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#2-pyromancy--flame-blast-basic-continuous-effect)

*Flames envelop one of the wyrd’s weapons, causing anything touched by it to similarly burst into fire.*

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, one weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait carried by this fighter gains the Blaze trait.

### 3. CHRONOMANCY – FREEZE TIME (DOUBLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#3-chronomancy--freeze-time-double)

*Reality seems to thicken all around the fighter, and events slow down to a crawl – has time truly stopped, or are those caught in the power merely experiencing its flow differently?*

All fighters, friend and foe, within 12" of this fighter may only perform a single action when activated for the remainder of this round.

### 4. TECHNOMANCY – WEAPON JINX (SIMPLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#4-technomancy--weapon-jinx-simple)

*With a snap of their fingers, the wyrd causes an enemy’s weapon to malfunction.*

Choose an enemy fighter that is within 18" of this fighter. That enemy fighter must immediately make an Ammo test for one of their weapons, chosen by this fighter’s controlling player.

### 5. TELEPATHY – TERRIFY (DOUBLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#5-telepathy--terrify-double)

*Planting a horrific image in an enemy’s mind, the wyrd tries to break their spirit.*

Choose a single enemy fighter that is both within 18" and line of sight of this fighter. That fighter must immediately take a Nerve test with a -3 modifier applied to the roll or becomes Broken.

### 6. BIOMANCY – QUICKENING (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/psykers#6-biomancy--quickening-basic-continuous-effect)

*The wyrd pours psychic energy into their muscles, greatly increasing their reflexes.*

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, improve this fighter’s Movement characteristic by 3 and their Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill and Initiative characteristics by 1 (to a maximumof 2+).

# WYRD POWERS

*Source: Book of the Outcast*

*All across Necromunda, there are those touched by the malign influence of the Warp. Some of these individuals are even able to tap into this immaterial realm and channel its power, manifesting psychic abilities that defy the laws of nature and Mankind. While the Imperium severely sanctions anyone with these abilities, or anyone in league with them, it does not stop psykers from propagating throughout Necromunda. Known among the underhive as wyrds, those with psychic gifts are much sought after by gangs, Guilds and criminals alike to provide an edge in the endless wars between the Clan Houses. Some wyrds even band together to form their own gangs, becoming the scourge of the underhive – at least until they are hunted down and exterminated!*

This section, designed to work alongside the rules for psykers presented in the Necromunda Rulebook, greatly expands upon the Wyrd Powers available to players and Arbitrators in their games. Presented here are seven Wyrd Power disciplines that can be used by psykers: Biomancy, Chronomancy, Divination, Pyromancy, Technomancy, Telepathy and Telekinesis.

## USING WYRD POWER DISCIPLINES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#using-wyrd-power-disciplines)

Any fighter with the Sanctioned Psyker special rule or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule can make use of the disciplines presented here using the guidelines below. Unless allowed by the Arbitrator, Dramatis Personae cannot use these discipline powers, and must instead use the powers presented with their profiles (as they are unique individuals often with unique powers).

- Unless otherwise specified, all fighters with the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule start with a single Wyrd Power, either chosen from those included in their gang list or from one of the disciplines presented here.
- [Bounty Hunters](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hired-guns/bounty-hunters/#0-1-generic-bounty-hunter) and [Venator Hunt Leaders](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/venators#hunt-leader-leader) can be upgraded when hired to have the Sanctioned Psyker or Nonsanctioned Psyker special rule (as chosen by the player) for +35 credits.
- A Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker may choose any Wyrd Power from those presented here (instead of one from their gang list) as an Advancement, just as they would gain a Primary skill as an Advancement (either by generating a power randomly for 9 XP, or choosing one for 12 XP).
- There is no limit to the number of Wyrd Powers a fighter may know.
- If all of a fighter‘s Wyrd Powers are chosen from a single Wyrd Power discipline, they will automatically gain that discipline’s special ability. Note, however, that should the fighter ever gain a power from a different discipline, this ability is immediately lost.
- Finally, when a fighter takes a dose of Ghast, they may generate their Wyrd Power from those presented here; this must still be a random Wyrd Power, though you may choose which discipline the power is from.

INFO

### FORCE WEAPONS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#force-weapons)

Some rare melee weapons, commonly known as force weapons in the vernacular of the underhive, are specially attuned to those with wyrd powers and can be devastating killing tools in their hands. Such weapons are usually created by taking high-quality versions of mundane close combat weapons, which are then inlaid with psi-amplifiers that channel the power of the Warp, allowing the wielder to deliver killing blows accentuated by their own wyrd powers.

Any weapon with the Melee trait can be upgraded into a Force Weapon by buying a Psi-amplifier from the Trading Post and performing the Psi Attune post-battle action (see page 127).

In the hands of a non-psyker, a Force Weapon has no additional effects. However, when wielded by a fighter with either the Sanctioned Psyker or Non-sanctioned Psyker special rule, the weapon gains both the Power and Sever traits.

## BIOMANCY DISCIPLINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#biomancy-discipline)

*Biomancy is the psychic mastery of flesh and bone; those gifted in its practise are able to knit flesh together, turn their skin to iron or inflict crippling pain upon their enemies. Such individuals are known as biomancers and are often skilled fighters who use their gifts to shrug off wounds while enhancing their speed, strength and endurance to overcome their foes.*

### BIOMANCER SPECIAL ABILITY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#biomancer-special-ability)

If a Wyrd only selects powers from the Biomancy discipline, they gain the Fast Healing special rule:

**Fast Healing:** When this fighter makes a Recovery test, roll an extra Injury dice then choose one to discard.

### 1. ARACHNOSIS (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#1-arachnosis-basic-continuous-effect)

*The wyrd’s hands grow tiny serrated hairs across their palms, allowing them to cling to any surface with ease.*

## CHRONOMANCY DISCIPLINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#chronomancy-discipline)

*Among the strangest of all wyrds are those who can manipulate the very flow of time itself. Some would say that the chronomancer, as such psykers are known, do not actually alter time, but rather people’s perception of it, allowing them to seem to move as a blur, pass in and out of existence seemingly at will, or even freeze a moment in time to take perfect aim before allowing events to continue.*

### CHRONOMANCER SPECIAL ABILITY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#chronomancer-special-ability)

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Chronomancy discipline, they gain the Flicker special rule:

### 1. FREEZE TIME (DOUBLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#1-freeze-time-double)

### 2. SUPPRESS POWER (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#2-suppress-power-basic)

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, once per round, this fighter may force an enemy fighter to re-roll one successful BS or WS check if this fighter is the target of the attack.

## DIVINATION DISCIPLINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#divination-discipline)

*The ability to peer into the future is something common to many wyrds, for it is believed that the Warp, and its denizens, do not obey the normal constraints of time and space. Diviners, as wyrds talented in this discipline are known, are in high demand among the gangs and organisations of the underhive; for who wouldn’t want to be able to look into the future and anticipate the actions of their enemies before they even happen?*

### DIVINER SPECIAL ABILITY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#diviner-special-ability)

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Divination discipline, they gain the Future Sight special rule:

*The wyrd peers into the future to see what fate has in store for them.*

If this fighter is part of a gang during the Determine Scenario step of the pre-battle sequence, their gang may choose the scenario rather than rolling randomly.

### 4. FOREWARNING (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#4-forewarning-basic)

*Conversing with denizens of the Warp, the wyrd learns how best to exploit their current situation.*

While this fighter is part of a gang, that gang may increase their Crew size by 1 for the scenario, and may re-roll any rolls for Reinforcements. In addition, if this fighter is a sentry, the alarm will automatically be raised if they finish their movement within 6" of an enemy fighter.

### 6. VISIONS (DOUBLE), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#6-visions-double-continuous-effect)

*Enemies cannot hide from the wyrd while their gaze is fixed upon the Warp.*

While this Wyrd Power is maintained, all enemy fighters within 18" of this fighter that are in full cover count as being in partial cover, and all enemy fighters within 18" of this fighter that are in partial cover count as being in the open.

## PYROMANCY DISCIPLINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#pyromancy-discipline)

*Pyromancers are wyrds with the ability to conjure flames out of thin air. Exceedinglydeadly individuals, there is nothing subtle about their powers, the psyker abletoturnabattlefield into a blazing inferno with a snap of their fingers.*

### PYROMANCER SPECIAL ABILITY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#pyromancer-special-ability)

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Pyromancy discipline, they gain the Fire Shield special rule:

**Fire Shield:** This fighter cannot be set on fire. In other words, this fighter is immune to the Blaze condition and will never become subject to it.

### 1. BODY OF FLAME (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#1-body-of-flame-basic-continuous-effect)

| Scouring | - | T | - | - | 2 | - | 1 | - | Blaze, Template |

## TECHNOMANCY DISCIPLINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#technomancy-discipline)

*A strange and rare power, technomancy is the ability to psychically manipulate technology of all kinds. Technomancers, as wyrds who command these abilities are known, can with a mere thought cause weapons to fail or operate far past their peak performance, or harden a suit of armour. In the depths of the underhive, a technomancer is truly in their element, as they use their powers to turn the very battlefield against their enemies.*

### TECHNOMANCER SPECIAL ABILITY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#technomancer-special-ability)

## TELEKINESIS DISCIPLINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#telekinesis-discipline)

*Reaching out with their mind, a telekinetic can lift, hurl or crush objects without ever laying a finger on them; some are even able to use their powers to fly.*

## TELEPATHY DISCIPLINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#telepathy-discipline)

*Few wyrds are as feared as those who practise the discipline of telepathy. A telepath can tear secrets from another’s mind, make them think the wyrd has vanished even when they stand directly in front of them, or fill their foes with unreasoning terror. These wyrds are both the least trusted and the most coveted of all psykers on Necromunda.*

### TELEPATH SPECIAL ABILITY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#telepath-special-ability)

If a wyrd only selects powers from the Telekinesis discipline, they gain the Fearful Aura special rule:

Whenever a friendly fighter takes a Nerve test or makes a Willpower check whilst within 9" of this fighter, they may use this fighter’s Cool or Willpower characteristic instead of their own.
