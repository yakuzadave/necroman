# Necromunda Rules - Gangs

# GANGS

The first thing any aspiring gang leader needs is a gang of followers. Most gang leaders are experienced fighters, champions or heroes who have struck out on their own to further their legend and strengthen their position within their House. Accompanying these renowned fighters will be a core of close allies from their former gang, competent and seasoned fighters all. These fighters will form the core of the new gang, creating its hierarchy and leadership.

To these dangerous individuals will flock aspiring gangers, the foot soldiers of their House. These fighters will be joined by green Juves and youthful Prospects. Juves are inexperienced rookies – in the parlance of Necromunda, those individuals with little to no fighting experience hoping to be accepted into a gang and prove their worth. Prospects represent the young hopefuls of the House. Often, these fighters are the sons and daughters of past gangers. Such fighters bring with them great potential, and a great weight of responsibility to their forebears.

# HOUSE CAWDOR

*Faith; in all of Necromunda there are few weapons as dangerous or as enduring. Nothing yet created by the Noble Houses compares to the damage faith has done to their people, and nothing in the entire hive world unites its inhabitants so surely. Even the fear of Lord Helmawr and the Imperial House cannot compete with true faith, and it is in this that House Cawdor’s power lies. All the other Clan Houses and Noble Houses are built upon alliances, the exchange of wealth, and obligation; their roots tied inexplicably to the industry of the hive world. Though House Cawdor shares in this industry, it is not defined by it. Rather, where most count credits each cycle to measure the worth of their subjects, the people of Clan Cawdor consider themselves strong so long as their faith remains strong. This has saved Cawdor from extinction where so many other Clan Houses have succumbed to the march of time or the ebb and flow of production quotas. For even while Cawdor languishes beneath its peers in terms of wealth and military might, it has never been poor in its beliefs.*

*From the outside, other Necromundans see House Cawdor as bonepickers, scavengers and beggars, little better than the hive rats that plague their holesteads. Only the mantle of being born of a Clan House elevates them above the clanless masses or the serf class, though most self-respecting subjects of Lord Helmawr will not deal with them. However, they do perform a vital role within hive society, picking through the refuse and cast-offs of the factoria, so that nothing might go to waste. If this were the only thing they were known for, Clan Cawdor might be better accepted by their peers. As it is, few can think of the Clan House without thinking of the faith that drives them. And they are not mistaken in this belief, for on Necromunda, Clan Cawdor and the Redemptionist faith are one and the same.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#gang-composition)

House Cawdor follows the [normal rules](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.

## SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#special-rules)

Follow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:

- [Articles of Faith](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#articles-of-faith)
- [Devout Masses](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#devout-masses),
- **Redemptionist Juve (Zealot):**
    - Counts as a Juve (Specialist) for the purpose of not triggering Nerve tests to other friendly fighters when Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action. Other Juve (Specialists) must still take Nerve tests as normal.
- **Juve (Promotion):**
    - Any Juve can be promoted to Redemptionist Ganger (Specialist).
    - Only Cawdor Juves can be promoted to Cawdor Ganger (Specialist).
- **Death of a Leader:** If a fighter is promoted to new Leader's type will depend on the successor's type:
    - Cawdor: Cawdor or Redemptionist.
    - Redemptionist: Redemptionist.
- **Pious (Cawdor):** Can re-roll Rally tests if the result is 2 (before modifiers).
- **Fanatical (Redemptionist):** Can re-roll Nerve tests if the result is 2 (before modifiers).
- **Corrupted/Infected (Chaos, Genestealer Cult):** Cannot generate or use Faith dice.

NOTE

The distinction between 'Cawdor' and 'Redemptionist' is only used for the purposes of Piety/Fanatical and alignment, all fighters are otherwise considered 'Cawdor'.

## CAWDOR FIGHTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#cawdor-fighters)

**100CREDITS**

### WORD-KEEPER (LEADER)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#word-keeper-leader)

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |

| 5” | 3+ | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 2 | 4+ | 2 | 4+ | 6+ | 5+ | 6+ |

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).

**Restrictions:** None.

**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2), Pious, The Path We Follow.

*Word-Keepers are the priests of the House of Faith and bind not only its society together but also lead its warriors into battle. A Word-Keeper who ventures into the underhive on the business of the House considers himself to be on a holy mission to spread the word of the Redemption, though to other underhivers he is often seen as just another gang leader.*

**90CREDITS**

### FIREBRAND (CHAMPION)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#firebrand-champion)

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).

**Restrictions:** None.

**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1), Pious, Righteous Warrior.

### RIGHTEOUS WARRIOR[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#righteous-warrior)

Once per battle, can re-roll a Threshold test to perform an Act of Faith (all dice must be re-rolled).

*Firebrands are the righteous right hand of the Word-Keepers and ever ready to dispense holy justice in the name of the faith. Well-practised and determined fighters, their gifts for violence are further supplemented by a significantly better selection of weaponry than most Cawdor Brethren, weaponry they are more than happy to use on the enemies of the Redemption.*

**45CREDITS**

### CAWDOR BRETHREN (GANGER)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#cawdor-brethren-ganger)

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |

| 5” | 4+ | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4+ | 1 | 7+ | 7+ | 7+ | 7+ |

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Ganger), Promotion (Cawdor Specialist), Pious, Tools of the Trade (Cawdor Specialist), Devout Masses (Ganger).

*Cawdor Brethren are the foot soldiers of the Redemption. Masked lest their individuality makes them seem too proud, they are armed with crude polearms, fashioned after the Emperor’s bodyguard’s own mighty weapons.*

**80CREDITS**

### CAWDOR WAY-BRETHREN (PROSPECT)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#cawdor-way-brethren-prospect)

| 6” | 4+ | 5+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3+ | 1 | 8+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ |

**Wargear:** Ridge Walker.

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Cawdor Firebrand or Redemptionist Deacon), Born in the Saddle, Hot-headed, Fast Learner, Pious.

### PROMOTION (CAWDOR FIREBRAND OR REDEMPTIONIST DEACON)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#promotion-cawdor-firebrand-or-redemptionist-deacon)

If, during the Downtime phase of a campaign, this fighter has gained five or more Advancements, this fighter may be promoted to become either a Cawdor Firebrand or a Redemptionist Deacon as the controlling player wishes.

When a fighter is promoted in this way, they will from now on count as a Cawdor Firebrand or a Redemptionist Deacon for the purposes of determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. Their existing characteristics do not change, but they will lose the Promotion (Cawdor Firebrand or Redemptionist Deacon), Born in the Saddle, Hot-headed, Fast Learner and Pious special rules and gain all the special rules associated with a Cawdor Firebrand or a Redemptionist Deacon, as appropriate.

Note that when a fighter is promoted in this way (especially when promoted to become a Redemptionist Deacon), an appropriate model should be used to represent their new category and type.

### BORN IN THE SADDLE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#born-in-the-saddle)

This fighter is more comfortable on their mount than onfoot and would never be without it. Their Ridge Walker must be included on every Fighter card for this fighter.

### HOT-HEADED[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#hot-headed)

Fighters with this special rule have much to prove and often act on impulse alone, hoping to impress their superiors. Consequently, older and wiser fighters expect them to be short-lived. Should a fighter with this special rule be Seriously Injured or be taken Out of Action, friendly fighters that are within 3" do not have to take a Nerve test, unless they also have this special rule.

### FAST LEARNER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#fast-learner)

During Campaign play, when this fighter gains a characteristic Advancement, they do not need to spend an additional 2 XP if the characteristic being improved has already been improved. In other words, this fighter may improve a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum) for the basic XP cost shown each time.

### PIOUS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#pious)

A devout member of House Cawdor, this fighter adheres closely to the teachings of the Redemption, whilst dutifully denying the path of the fanatic. In addition, if this fighter rolls a natural double 1 on their Cool check when making a Rally test, they may immediately re-roll that Cool check.

**20CREDITS**

### BONEPICKER (JUVE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#bonepicker-juve)

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |

| 6” | 5+ | 5+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3+ | 1 | 8+ | 8+ | 8+ | 9+ |

**Restrictions:** Pistol, Basic, Close Combat.

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Cawdor or Redemptionist Specialist), Fast Learner, Pious, Devout Masses (Juve).

*Bonepickers are the teeming masses of House Cawdor. When a Word-Keeper wants a ready supply of fighters he will recruit them from nearby Cawdor settlements, pressing scavenged weapons into their hands and sending them off into the fray.*

**90CREDITS**

### 0-2 SHEEN BIRD (EXOTIC BEAST)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#0-2-sheen-bird-exotic-beast)

**Cost:** 90

| 6” | 4+ | 6+ | 3 | 2 | 1 | 3+ | 2 | 8+ | 7+ | 8+ | 9+ |

**Wargear:** Mandibles (same as: talons & beak).

**Special Rules:** Flight, Bate, Rake Away.

### FLIGHT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#flight)

Ignores all terrain, moves freely between levels without restriction and can never fall. May not ignore impassable terrain or walls and may not end its movement with its base overlapping an obstacle or the base of another fighter.

### BATE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#bate)

When the owning fighter activates, make a Willpower test for the owning fighter. If failed, the Sheen Bird must attempt to charge the closest enemy fighter. If passed, the Sheen Bird activates as normal.

### RAKE AWAY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#rake-away)

At the end of the activation, if the owner is Active or Pinned, a Willpower test can be made. If passed, make a free Move (Simple) action, or Retreat (Basic) action if Engaged, directly towards the owning fighter.

*Ancient biomechanical constructs, created long ago to evoke an illusory sense of the long-lost splendour of the natural world, sheen birds were once wonders, combining the finest mechanical constructions of the Cult Cybernetica with the most elegant clone-craft of the Cult Biologus. They were possessed of a rudimentary programming, causing them to mimic real birds; flocking together, roosting, feeding, even nesting.*

*Over the millennia, sheen bird numbers have gradually dwindled through lack of preservation, with the surviving examples becoming corrupted beyond recognition. Their flesh is diseased and their plumage is scarce. The remaining sheen birds are foul things, infested with parasites and filthy with pollution. Even their rudimentary programming has corrupted, causing them to act as sinister parodies of real birds.*

*Occasionally, sheen birds will make their way into the lower levels of the underhive. Here they are greeted with awe by the devoted of House Cawdor, who view them as avatars of the Emperor’s grace. For high ranking Cawdor gangers, to possess a sheen bird is akin to possessing the direct blessing of the Emperor himself.*

### PIOUS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#pious-1)

A devout member of House Cawdor, this model adheres closely to the teachings of the Redemption, whilst dutifully denying the path of the fanatic. If this model rolls a natural double 1 on their Cool check when making a Rally test, they may immediately re-roll that Cool check.

### ONE OF THE FAITHFUL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#one-of-the-faithful)

If this model is neither Wrecked nor Broken during the End phase, this model generates Faith dice as if they were a ganger. Additionally, this model may not be affected by any Article of Faith.

**Restrictions:** None.

**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2), Fanatical, The Path We Follow.

*Redemptor Priests are the true fanatics of the faith and each follows one of the extreme paths based on an obscure reference or inference from the holy book of the Redemption. Without exception they are extreme and dangerous individuals, each one capable of raising a mob of angry hivers with an impassioned sermon or personally delivering justice with flame and blood.*

**90CREDITS**

### REDEMPTIONIST DEACON (CHAMPION)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#redemptionist-deacon-champion)

Once per battle, can gain the following when Charging:

- 2xA (base stat).
- 1 hit modifier.

*Deacons are the champions of the Redemptionist crusade, Brethren who, through their deeds, have risen up to stand above the common rabble. To say Deacons have a talent for violence is to do them a disservice, the fighters always at the forefront of any Redemptionist assault armed with fire and fury, showing the Brethren of the gang how it is done.*

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Ganger), Promotion (Redemptionist Specialist), Tools of the Trade (Redemptionist Specialist), Fanatical.

4+ save (unmodifiable by AP)

*Created by the Magi Biologis, cherub-servitors are a common sight on Imperial worlds, particularly so amongst the many branches of the Imperial Creed. Their use varies depending upon need, with many serving a purely decorative or ritual purpose, bearing censers or holy icons during the endless sermons of the Ecclesiarchy. Others carry small items for those they serve or, in some cases, operate machinery high in the domes and rafters of shrines and cathedrals.*

*The Orders Militant and Frateris Militia are often accompanied to war by cherubservitors. Here they fulfil a number of roles, from porting ammunition and wargear to acting as a form of mobile cover or ablative armour, protecting those they serve by sacrificing their own vat-grown bodies. It is not uncommon to see well-funded Redemptionists similarly accompanied by cherub-servitors. How these criminal rabble rousers come into possession of such companions is something of a mystery, suggesting links to Noble Houses, and even sects within the Ecclesiarchy itself.*

### INTELLIGENT CONTROL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#intelligent-control)

Can re-roll any failed Leadership, Cool, Willpower or Intelligence tests.

### MOVE AND SHOOT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/#move-and-shoot)

Can fire Unwieldy weapons as a Basic action with a -1 hit modifier (instead of the normal Double action).

*The preachers and rabble-rousers of the devout of House Cawdor have little tolerance for the mutant and the abhuman. Such deformities of the body are clear evidence, so their leaders tell them, of the corruption that lurks within the soul. How can anyone who lives their life in loyalty to the Emperor, anyone who dedicates their every action to his glory, their every moment of toil to the betterment of his Imperium, ever become so corrupt and debased of form? Physical abnormalities are clear evidence, then, that those afflicted have turned their gaze away from his light and shunned Him as their one true master, and so the devout of House Cawdor will hunt them down and exterminate such affronts to Him on Terra with great prejudice, wherever they attempt to hide from his light.*

*And yet, exceptions not only exist within the teeming ranks of House Cawdor, but could even be called… common. Many denizens of Cawdor are lame of body or weak of wit. Many are abnormally large or strangely proportioned and peculiar to behold. How it is that such variation from the accepted baseline norm of humanity can be tolerated within a House that claims to despise such variations is something of a mystery, but to the Cawdor themselves the answer is simply one of faith. If their leaders choose to allow these souls to live, then live they will, just like any other Cawdor, dedicating their lives to the holy cause. A common sight amongst the peoples of House Cawdor is that of the physically frail and the weak of mind coexisting, working together to do for one another that which they cannot do alone. Sometimes regarded as bearers of stigma, sometimes called ‘stigs’ amongst the gangs of House Cawdor, but never ‘mutants’, lest the speaker wish to provoke a violent reaction, these combinations of shambling, slack-jawed behemoth and shrewd-yet-wizened rider can be a great asset to any Cawdor gang seeking to establish dominance in the underhive.*

*Truly, House Cawdor is home to some strange sights indeed!*

# ARTICLES OF FAITH

*Source: House of Faith*

*There is no greater weapon in the arsenal of the Imperium than faith. This is a fact as true among the greater diaspora of humanity as it is on Necromunda, and in the depths of the hive cities there are none more faithful than the followers of the Redemption. Tales abound of members of Clan Cawdor overcoming terrible wounds, delivering devastating blows or even cheating death itself through the strength of their belief. While undoubtedly many of these tales are either exaggerated or outright fabrications, enough evidence exists to make those who have faced the warriors of the Redemption wonder just what it might have been that turned aside their bullet or lent strength to the attacks of their foes – was it just luck, or was something divine at work?*

Articles of Faith are a collection of rules that apply to all House Cawdor fighters. As they focus on the faith and conviction of the followers of the Redemption they are not so clean cut as things like Skills, Wargear or bionics that grant their users clearly defined benefits at an XP or credit cost. Rather, should a Cawdor fighter believe strongly enough in themselves, their brothers and the God-Emperor, something miraculous might happen. Equally though, should the fighter’s faith falter, then the gifts of the God-Emperor that were so graciously bestowed upon them might just as easily be taken away.

## FAITH DICE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#faith-dice)

Faith dice represent the religious zeal of a Cawdor gang. These dice are a resource that all Cawdor gangs (except those that have become Chaos Corrupted or Genestealer Infected) generate over the course of a battle, and which can be used to attempt miraculous events known as ‘Articles of Faith’ – such as surviving a fatal blow or making an impossible leap.

### GENERATING FAITH DICE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#generating-faith-dice)

Faith is a strange thing – and those that attempt to understand how it works probably don’t have it. Sometimes a tide of righteous frenzy will envelop the fighters of House Cawdor, bearing them to victory on a tide of religious zeal. Other times the gaze of the God-Emperor will turn away from them, leaving them to their fate.

In the End phase of each round (including the first), count up the number of friendly House Cawdor fighters currently on the battlefield that are neither Seriously Injured or Broken, and roll a D6 for each. Each dice that rolls a 5 or 6 is added to a special pool of dice called the Faith dice pool (this can also be represented by tokens or notes on a piece of paper if it is easier).

Cawdor fighters may also attempt to work themselves up into a frenzy of faith – waving holy relics, chanting prayers or flagellating themselves – during their activation by performing the Beseech the God-Emperor (Double) action:

**Beseech the God-Emperor (Double):** During the End phase, roll three D6 for a fighter that performed this action, rather than the usual one.

Faith dice can be retained from one round to the next. However, if in the End phase, after generating Faith dice, there are more dice in the pool than there are friendly House Cawdor fighters on the battlefield, these excess dice must be discarded.

### USING FAITH DICE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#using-faith-dice)

When a Cawdor fighter activates, if there is at least one dice in the Faith dice pool, they may attempt to invoke an Article of Faith. Each Article of Faith only affects the fighter performing it (unless otherwise noted) and lasts until the start of that fighter’s next activation (unless otherwise noted). An Article of Faith must be invoked and performed at the start of a fighter’s activation, before performing any actions. Attempting an Article of Faith does not require the fighter to use one of their actions (unless otherwise noted).

When invoking an Article of Faith, the controlling player declares the Article of Faith the fighter is attempting to invoke. The fighter then makes a Threshold test. To make a Threshold test, the player chooses a number of Faith dice to roll, removing them from the Faith dice pool and rolling them. Once this roll has been made, the number of dice used cannot be changed, i.e., the player cannot roll more Faith dice to increase the total rolled. Once a dice has been taken from the Faith dice pool, it is used up and discarded:

- If the total result equals or exceeds the threshold of the Article of Faith being invoked, a miracle has occurred and the Article of Faith is performed successfully!
- If the total result is lower than the threshold of the Article of Faith being invoked, they have failed and the God-Emperor has turned his back on them.

## PATHS OF FAITH[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#paths-of-faith)

While the other Clan Houses see little difference between the varied followers of the Redemption – perhaps only making some vague distinction between the law abiding and the outlaw – there are in fact myriad splinter faiths within House Cawdor. Most Redemptionist faiths stay more or less true to the core tenets of the Clan House, those rules that reflect tried and true beliefs. Some stray, or include divergent philosophies.

These divergent beliefs are represented in games of Necromunda by the four ‘Paths of Faith’. These are the Path of the Faithful, the Path of the Fanatic, the Path of the Doomed, and the Path of the Redeemer.

The Path of Faith a House Cawdor gang follows is determined by their Leader and must be chosen when the gang is first created. Once a Path has been chosen the Leader may not choose another or change it. However, should the Leader die, their successor may choose their own Path – affecting the rest of the gang as normal.

Each Path grants the gang access to a different set of Articles of Faith, reflecting the ideologies of the gang members. There are also certain benefits conferred by the path a gang follows.

### PATH OF THE FAITHFUL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#path-of-the-faithful)

The Path of the Faithful is the path followed by the great majority of House Cawdor. It is the path of the Redemption, an extreme interpretation of the Imperial Creed that fills many with dread and fear. Whilst most members of House Cawdor consider themselves moderate, to outsiders there is little distinction between a moderate Redemptionist and an outlawed follower of a fanatical fringe. If a Leader has chosen this Path, their gang gains the following benefits:

- When generating Faith dice, an additional D6 is rolled for each friendly House Cawdor Leader or Champion that is currently on the battlefield and that is not either Seriously Injured or Broken.
- The following Articles of Faith can only be performed by members of a House Cawdor gang that follows the Path of the Faithful.

| Article of Faith | Effect | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “And Contempt shall be My Armour!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, this fighter and any friendly House Cawdor fighters within 6" of them may not be targeted by and are immune to the effects of psychic powers. However, should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, this fighter reduces their Willpower by 1 for the remainder of this battle. | 4+ |
| “And Lo His Gaze did Illuminate them!” | The fighter can attack through smoke clouds and ignores the Pitch Black rules. In addition, if they are hit by a Flash weapon, add 1 to the result of the Initiative check to see whether they become subject to the Blind condition. | 3+ |
| “And the Word fell upon them, and they were Broken by it!” | All enemy fighters that are within 9" of this fighter and that can draw a line of sight to this fighter must immediately make a Nerve test. However, should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, this fighter must immediately make a Nerve test. | 5+ |
| “And by Their Works shall They be known!” | One enemy Psyker within 12" of this fighter and that can draw a line of sight to this fighter must immediately make a Leadership check. If this check is failed, the enemy psyker must roll on the Perils of the Warp table. | 5+ |
| “And the Heart of the Heretic was easily cowed!” | One enemy fighter within 12" of this fighter and that can draw a line of sight to this fighter must immediately make an Intelligence check. If this check is failed, they lose their Ready marker (if they have one). However, should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, this fighter’s activation ends immediately. | 8+ |
| “And those of Warped and Twisted Limb shall be Despised!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, all friendly Cawdor fighters within 6" of this fighter and that can draw a line of sight to this fighter (including this fighter) may re-roll any failed Hit rolls made against Brutes (including Spawn), pets, critters, or enemy fighters with mutations. | 7+ |

### PATH OF THE FANATIC[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#path-of-the-fanatic)

Those who follow the Path of the Fanatic embody the frenzy of faith the Redemption is so well known for. The Red Walk, Disciples of the Burning Brand and the Children of Blessed Day are all examples of splinter faiths of the Redemption who follow the Path of the Fanatic. If a Leader has chosen this Path, their gang gains the following benefits:

- When generating Faith dice, an additional D6 is rolled for each friendly House Cawdor fighter that is Engaged with an enemy fighter.
- The following Articles of Faith can only be performed by members of a House Cawdor gang that follows the Path of the Fanatic.

| Article of Faith | Effect | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “And Lo, I did spread my Wings and the God-Emperor carried me aloft!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, this fighter may add 3D6" to their Movement when attempting to leap a gap. When attempting to jump down to a level below, this fighter can reduce the distance measured (and therefore reduce the risk) by D6+2".Players should note that, when invoking this Article of Faith, they must declare the move this fighter intends to make, including the leap or jump. If this fighter fails to pass the Threshold test for this Article of Faith, they must still move and attempt the leap or jump (should they fall, their faith was clearly lacking). | 5+ |
| “And by our Pain shall He Judge our worth!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, this fighter improves their Toughness by 3. However, this fighter will suffer a Flesh Wound. If the fighter did not pass the threshold for this Article of Faith, this Flesh Wound is applied immediately. If the fighter did pass the Threshold test, this Flesh Wound is applied when this Article of Faith expires. | 5+ |
| “And without thought He Smote Them Down!” | The fighter immediately makes a free Charge (Double) action (i.e., does not use any of their actions). However, this fighter suffers a -2 modifier to their Hit rolls for the remainder of this round. Should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, this fighter suffers a -2 modifier to their Hit rolls for the remainder of this battle. | 6+ |
| “And His Feet carried him into the fray!” | The fighter can make an immediate free Move (Simple) action. However, this fighter suffers an immediate Flesh Wound, regardless of whether or not they successfully pass the Threshold test for the Article of Faith. | 2+ |
| “And He stood Defiant upon the mountain!” | When this fighter is hit by a ranged attack, they do not become Prone and Pinned. However, whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, this fighter is unable to perform a Take Cover (Basic) action and does not benefit from partial cover. | 5+ |
| “And He Gave Unto Them the Emperor’s Mercy!” | Unlike other Articles of Faith, this one is not invoked at the start of a fighter’s activation. Instead, a House Cawdor fighter may interrupt the activation of an enemy fighter that wishes to perform a Coup De Grace (Simple) action against that House Cawdor fighter.If the Threshold test is passed, this fighter may interrupt that fighter’s activation to perform a free Fight (Basic) action targeting the fighter performing the Coup De Grace (Simple) action. Note that this may prevent the Coup De Grace (Simple) action from being performed at all. | 5+ |

### PATH OF THE DOOMED[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#path-of-the-doomed)

The Path of the Doomed draws upon the core beliefs of the Redemption, and relishes in the death of all things. The Forsaken Truth, the Scions of the Void and the Cult of the True Resurrection are all examples of splinter faiths of the Redemption who follow the Path of the Doomed. If a Leader has chosen this Path, their gang gains the following benefits:

- If the Leader is Seriously Injured or has been taken Out of Action, or if the gang has failed a Bottle test, Faith dice are generated on a roll of 4+, rather than the usual roll of 5 or 6.
- The following Articles of Faith can only be performed by members of a House Cawdor gang that follows the Path of the Doomed.

| Article of Faith | Effect | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “And the people Rose Up in their multitudes to aid Him!” | If the Threshold test to invoke this Article of Faith is passed, this fighter may forfeit their actions for this activation to add D3 extra Cawdor fighters to the battlefield (these must be fighters belonging to this fighter’s gang who were not part of the crew for this battle). These new fighters arrive immediately and are deployed with Ready markers, touching the battlefield edge closest to this fighter, but not within 9" of an enemy fighter.However, should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, one randomly determined fighter belonging to this fighter’s gang that is not part of the crew for this battle is immediately taken Captive by the enemy gang. | 8+ |
| “And by the manner of his Death did the Emperor judge him!” | The fighter may immediately perform a single Move (Simple) action. After they have moved, centre the Large Blast (5") marker on them. All fighters under the marker suffer an automatic Str 3, Ap-, D1 hit. Once all hits have been resolved, this fighter goes Out of Action. | 5+ |
| “And in the Grace of the Emperor even Death was Defied!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, this fighter ignores the effects of being Seriously Injured and cannot be taken Out of Action until the end of their next activation, at which time they automatically go Out of Action. | 8+ |
| “And in His Light were they struck blind!” | Any fighter that is within 6" of this fighter (including this fighter) cannot make ranged attacks against targets more than 3" away from them, nor can they be targeted by a ranged attack made by a fighter that is more than 3" away from them. | 5+ |
| “And a river of blood did Drown Them!” | In the End phase of this round, the enemy gang must count those fighters belonging to this fighter’s gang that have gone Out of Action as if they were friendly fighters when making a Bottle test. | 11+ |
| “And upon a Fortress of Bone shall my Strength be built!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, this fighter increases their Strength and Toughness by a number equal to the number of friendly House Cawdor fighters with the Gang Fighter (Ganger) special rule that have gone Out of Action (to a maximum of +3). However, should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, this fighter reduces their Strength and Toughness by 1 for the remainder of this battle. | 6+ |

### PATH OF THE REDEEMER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#path-of-the-redeemer)

There are faithful within the Redemption who see it as their duty to purify the souls of the faithless – these follow the Path of the Redeemer. The Red Redemption, the Followers of Klovis and the Glorium Excrucium are all examples of splinter faiths of the Redemption who follow the Path of the Redeemer. If a Leader has chosen this Path, their gang gains the following benefits:

- When generating Faith dice, roll one additional dice for each enemy fighter that is either Seriously Injured or that was taken Out of Action during this round.
- The following Articles of Faith can only be performed by members of a House Cawdor gang that follows the Path of the Redeemer.

| Article of Faith | Effect | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “And each Blow shall be a Barb unto my enemy’s flesh!” | Any enemy fighter that wishes to make a close combat attack that targets this fighter must first make a Willpower check. If this check is failed, that fighter immediately suffers a Flesh Wound. | 5+ |
| “And Flame shall Burn Away their sin!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, attacks made by this fighter with weapons that have the Melee or Versatile trait gain the Blaze trait. However, should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, this fighter immediately becomes subject to the Blaze condition. | 3+ |
| “And with Iron Teeth shall they be Devoured!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, this fighter may re-roll any failed Wound rolls made when using a chain weapon (e.g., a chainsword, chainaxe, chain glaive or eviscerator). | 5+ |
| “And Agony brought the unbelievers Low!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, enemy fighters that have suffered a Flesh Wound, that are within 6" of this fighter and that can draw a line of sight to this fighter can only perform a single action during their activation. However, should the Threshold test be failed and this Article of Faith not be invoked, this fighter can only perform a single action during this activation. | 7+ |
| “And in His Gaze were they Found Wanting!” | The fighter can use their activation to ‘Judge’ one enemy fighter that is within 9" and that they can draw a line of sight to. A Judged fighter must immediately make a Willpower check. If this check is failed, they cannot perform any actions during their next activation. | 9+ |
| “And Death could not stay His Righteous Wrath!” | If this fighter is taken Out of Action before their next activation, one enemy fighter chosen by this fighter’s controlling player that is within 6" of this fighter and that can draw a line of sight to this fighter suffers an automatic Str 5, Ap-1, D2 hit. | 7+ |

### DESIGNER’S NOTE: FORGE YOUR OWN PATH[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#designers-note-forge-your-own-path)

During Campaign play, should players wish, they can choose not to follow any of the Paths of Faith previously described and can instead forge their own. Doing so allows a gang leader to choose up to four Articles of Faith which will form the basis for their gang’s unique beliefs. However, selecting this option does enable players to choose a combination of Articles of Faith that may prove very powerful when used in battle. It is therefore essential that, should a player wish to forge their own Path, the Arbitrator first grants permission.

Should a gang leader wish to forge their own Path, follow these steps:

- **Name your Path:** Before forging their own Path, the player must first name the Path. Doing so is an essential step that will help define the beliefs of the gang. Without this first step, players may simply be choosing what they feel is the best combination of Articles of Faith to use, and that should be avoided!
- **Choose your Beliefs:** Choose up to four different Articles of Faith from those listed previously. These will form the basis of the gang’s unique Path of Faith. This could be one Article of Faith from each Path, or any other combination the player wishes.

Finally, players should note that when forging their own Path, their gang will not gain any of the benefits associated with any of the Paths of Faith.

### PATH OF THE PROPHET[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/articles-of-faith#path-of-the-prophet)

DESIGNER’S COMMENTARY: PATHS OF FAITH

Presented below are the rules for the Path of the Prophet, a new path for the Cawdor Articles of Faith rules (as detailed above). These rules allow players to recreate the action detailed in Nexus of Violence and, if the Arbitrator wishes, these new rules may be included in their campaign.

*Source: Apocrypha Necromunda: Nexus of Violence*

The Path of the Prophet is the utter devotion to the word of the Prophet and the Great Pilgrimage which he leads. Its followers see this path as the one true expression of the Redemption, and the Prophet himself as ordained by the God-Emperor to lead all who claim devotion to the Imperial Creed. During the Aranthian Succession millions of faithful would flock to the banner of the Prophet, until they dominated the fractured House of Cawdor in their relentless quest to convert or destroy all who opposed their holy master.

- When generating Faith dice, if your crew outnumbers your opponent’s crew (only counting fighters currently on the battlefield that are not Seriously Injured or Broken), roll an additional number of D6s equal to the number of fighters your crew outnumbers your opponent’s crew by.
- The following Articles of Faith can only be performed by members of a House Cawdor gang that follows the Path of the Prophet.

| Article of Faith | Effect | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Look not upon the Face of the Prophet, lest he Blind you with his Glory!” | All other fighters (both friend and foe) within 12" of the fighter invoking this Article of Faith change their facing so that their vision arcs are facing directly away from the invoking fighter. | 5+ |
| “By his Word shall you be Redeemed and in his Name shall you Serve!” | The invoking fighter targets an enemy fighter they are engaged with. The targeted fighter must make a Willpower test, if they fail they become subject to the Insane condition. | 8+ |
| “Look to the Light Of The Prophet!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, all fighters (both friend and foe) within 12" of the invoking fighter are unaffected by the Visibility (X) rule. | 3+ |
| “Look not to the counsel of False Masters!” | Whilst this Article of Faith is in effect, all enemy fighters within 12" of the invoking fighter cannot benefit from Group Activations or the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rules. | 7+ |
| “Let those who Fear, Fear Not, and those who Fear Not, Know Fear!” | All Broken fighters (both friend and foe) within 12" of the invoking fighter immediately Rally. All other fighters (both friend and foe) must take a Nerve test. | 6+ |
| “Empty are the Hands of the Faithless!” | While this Article of Faith is in effect, enemy fighters count as being Unarmed when making close combat attacks against the invoking fighter. | 4+ |

# CAWDOR TERRAIN

*Source: House of Faith*

Gangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Cawdor gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s stash, and can be fielded in any game the gang plays unless noted otherwise.

## PLACING GANG TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#placing-gang-terrain)

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man’s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

### CAWDOR TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#cawdor-terrain-1)

| Terrain | Cost (Credits) | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Divine Brazier | 80 | Common |
| Incendiary Trap | 30 | Common |
| Hive Incense | 40 | Rare (7) |
| Caged Heretic | 40 | Rare (9) |
| Holy Gang-Relic | 30 | Rare (8) |

INFO

## HIDDEN TRAPS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#hidden-traps)

Some traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap’s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the battlefield. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the battlefield until they have been interacted with – this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.

## DIVINE BRAZIER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#divine-brazier)

The gangs of House Cawdor often daub symbols of the faith on the walls of the underhive, or bring along icons hammered together from hive scrap to inspire them – these icons are more often than not on fire. A Divine Brazier can be placed anywhere in the Cawdor gang’s deployment zone. If the Pitch Black rules are being used then all fighters within 3" of the Divine Brazier count as revealed. As a simple action, any fighter may dip a weapon with the Melee or Versatile trait in the brazier, giving the weapon the Blaze trait until the End phase of the following round.

A Divine Brazier should be represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 32mm Necromunda base.

## INCENDIARY TRAP[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#incendiary-trap)

The gangs of House Cawdor often make crude incendiary traps that can douse an entire area in flame. An Incendiary Trap is a Hidden trap (as described previously) and has the following profile:

| Weapon | Rg S | Rg L | Ac S | Ac L | S | AP | D | Am | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Incendiary Trap | - | - | - | - | 2 | -2 | 1 | - | Blast (5"), Blaze, Single Shot |

## HIVE INCENSE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#hive-incense)

As part of their religious rites, House Cawdor gangs often burn holy censers or tapers of incense – perhaps having seen such rituals being performed by the priests of the Ministorum. Unlike that august organisation, however, the incense burned by the Redemption is often far from ‘holy’. Hive Incense may be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy gang’s deployment zone and not within 6" of an enemy fighter. Any ranged attack that is made into, out of or across the area within 3" of the Hive Incense suffers a -1 modifier to the Hit roll.

In addition, all fighters – with the exception of House Cawdor fighters – that start their activation within 3" of a Hive Incense marker must make a Toughness check as if they had been hit by a weapon with the Gas trait (allowing them to use the modifier granted by filter plugs or a respirator, for example). If this check is failed, their first Move (simple) action must be made in a random direction, as determined by the Scatter dice.

Hive Incense is represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 32mm Necromunda base.

## CAGED HERETIC[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#caged-heretic)

As a warning to the faithless, House Cawdor gangs will sometimes bring along heretics, mutants or other unclean prisoners to display to their enemies. Transported in swaying gibbets, the prisoners are hung over the battlefield, where their piteous cries act as a reminder to the unworthy as to the price of opposing the Redemption. A Caged Heretic may be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy gang’s deployment zone and not within 6" of an enemy fighter. All fighters – with the exception of House Cawdor fighters – that end their movement within 6" of a Caged Heretic must make a Nerve test.

Caged Heretics cannot be targeted by shooting (it is assumed they cower in their cages if shot at), though if they are caught under a Blast marker or template roll a D6 – on a 3+ they are unaffected, otherwise they are destroyed and removed from the battlefield. Enemy fighters may also attempt to free the Caged Heretic by performing a Double action while in base contact with the Caged Heretic and making a Strength or Intelligence check. If the check is passed, remove the Caged Heretic from the battlefield and the fighter that freed them gains D3 XP.

A Caged Heretic is represented by a 32mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 32mm Necromunda base.

## HOLY GANG-RELIC[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-cawdor/cawdor-terrain#holy-gang-relic)

Holy Gang-Relics are sacred objects that hold great significance to the Redemption. It might be a battered autopistol (now long broken) that was once wielded by a great ‘saint’ of the clan, or perhaps a shattered fragment of armour that in a certain light looks like the face of the God-Emperor (or at least how the followers of the Redemption believe his face to look). A Holy Gang-Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Cawdor fighters within 6" of a Holy Gang- Relic are filled with a fervent zeal as they attempt to protect the object, and may apply a +1 modifier to both their Hit and Wound rolls.

Cawdor gangs can only include a Holy Gang-Relic if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender.

A Holy Gang-Relic can be represented by a 40mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 40mm Necromunda base.

If an enemy fighter is able to get within 1" of a Holy Gang-Relic, they can make a Defile Relic (Double) action. Once a Holy Gang-Relic has been defiled, it loses its special rules and cannot be defiled again. In a campaign, a fighter who defiles a Holy Gang-Relic gains D3 XP.

# HOUSE DELAQUE

*House Delaque, or the House of Shadow, as it is also commonly known, is one of the more unusual Clan Houses of Necromunda. Unlike the Goliath, Escher, Van Saar and Orlock Houses, that are built upon vital industries and lord their wealth and power over a substantial population of workers, or the Cawdor, who are bound together by faith and claim populations across the hive world as their own, the Delaque have no defined home and no defined industrial role within Necromundan society. If one were to ask a hiver what purpose the Delaque serve for Lord Helmawr, one would doubtless receive myriad answers. Some believe them to be information brokers, who deal in secrets and buy and sell this vital commodity to the highest bidder. Others claim they are afforded their place because of some clandestine deal with the Helmawr line, and that they are spies for the Imperial House, or perhaps one or more of the Noble Houses. Still others claim the Delaque are assassins and saboteurs without peer, and in a world where open warfare between Houses is forbidden, all must enlist their services if they want to advance their power and influence. Like all good lies there is a grain of truth in each of these beliefs. For instance it is true that the Delaque deal in information, and any hiver knows that if you can meet their price a Delaque info-broker can find out what you want to know. It is also true that there is some connection between Lord Helmawr and Delaque, though no one really knows the true nature of this relationship and it ranges from them being the Lord of Necromunda’s eyes and ears below the Wall to the Delaque being a bastard offshoot of the Imperial House itself. House Delaque is also known for the quality of its spies, assassins and saboteurs, though they do not market themselves like mercenaries, and these skills seem more to be a by-product of their true purpose… whatever that is.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#gang-composition)

House Delaque follows the [normal rules](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.

Upgrade for +30 credits when recruited to become an Unsanctioned Psyker and Psychoteric Mastery. The fighter must choose one discipline (Madness, Delusion or Darkness) to specialise in and may immediately select a single Wyrd Power from that discipline.

*A Master of Shadow is the very embodiment of the Psychoterica. They are everything the Delaque are known for – an invisible hand moving among the hives doing the will of the Star Chamber. Most hivers will never know if they have ever crossed paths with a Master of Shadow, such are the forms they might assume – and those who do peek behind the mask seldom live long to recount the experience.*

*A Nacht-Ghul is an assassin and saboteur without peer. Crafted by psychic-science and esoteric chems, they are the edge of the blade in the dark that cuts away the enemies of the Delaque – or the enemies of their friends if it suits their purposes. Delaque gangs will often include these talented agents, though they do so with the knowledge that the Nacht-Ghul ultimately answer to the Star Chamber and the whispers of the Psychoterica.*

Ignores all terrain, moves freely between levels without restriction and can never fall. May not ignore impassable terrain or walls and may not end its movement with its base overlapping an obstacle or the base of another fighter.

### WYRD POWERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#wyrd-powers)

**Psychic Assault (Basic)**

An enemy fighter within 18” is Pinned and must pass a Willpower test or suffer 1 Damage (if reduced to 0 Wounds, roll an Injury dice as normal).

**Psychic Scream (Basic)**

Enemy fighters within 3” must pass a Nerve test with a -1 modifier or become Broken.

**Force Blast (Basic)**

Any enemy fighters within 3” are immediately pushed D3+1” directly away. If a fighter is pushed from a platform or into a pitfall, they must pass an Initiative test to be placed Prone at the edge. Otherwise they will fall. If pushed into a wall or other impassable terrain, the fighter is immediately Pinned and takes a hit with a Strength equal to the number of inches rolled for the push distance.

NOTE

There has been a new Delaque fighter called a [Spyker](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-additions/hangers-on-and-brutes/hangers-on/#0-2-spyker) that was released in House of Shadows (whereas this was not included). Talk to your Arbitrator if you want to include this earlier version, as they may deem it invalid.

*Piscean Spektors are yet another mystery unique to the Delaque. Most other clans see little distinction between the Delaque Spektor forms and consider them merely another mechanical ally created by the House of Shadow. In truth, the Piscean Spektors are unlike anything else employed by the Delaque and are more akin to a true race in their own right. A cybernetic form wrapped around a harvested xenos brain, the Spektor retains much of its memories from its prior existence, and serves the Clan House in accordance with an ancient pact between humans and its race. While not even the Delaque know for sure where the Pisceans come from, it is believed they are an aquatic race that arrived on Necromunda millennia ago and made their home in its subterranean seas. Occasionally, ancient members of this race come to the Delaque to have their brains placed in machines, the two races sharing a common connection to the Psychoterica.*

*In life, a Piscean warrior is a ferocious aquatic alien, shark-headed and inhumanly strong. When its brain is interned in the shell of a Spektor, its connection to the Psychoterica becomes even stronger and it develops psychic powers. While still a competent warrior, favouring savage close quarters combat, its true strength is its ability to channel the Psychoterica into strange and deadly powers. This same ability allows it to float through the air, rapidly climb structures and move with a disturbing grace that belies its cumbersome form. When the Delaque are expecting trouble or staging an important assault, it is often to their Piscean Spektors they will turn, the creations perfectly adapted for combat in the underhive with a truly alien lust for battle.*

### 0-3 CEPHALOPOD SPEKTER (EXOTIC BEAST)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#0-3-cephalopod-spekter-exotic-beast)

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5” | 4+ | 5+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3+ | 1 | 7+ | 5+ | 8+ | 4+ |

**Weapons:** Shock stave (same as: shock tendrils).

**Special Rules:** Flight, Sensor Array, Threat Respose, Watchdog.

### FLIGHT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#flight-2)

Ignores all terrain, moves freely between levels without restriction and can never fall. May not ignore impassable terrain or walls and may not end its movement with its base overlapping an obstacle or the base of another fighter.

### SENSOR ARRAY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#sensor-array)

If within 3” when the owner makes an Intelligence test (for any reason), roll an extra D6 and pick a dice to discard.

### THREAD RESPONSE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#thread-response)

When the owner is taken Out of Action, all enemy fighters within D6” of this pet suffer a Strength 1 automatic hit with Seismic (always Pinned, no save roll if the wound roll is a 6 before modifiers).

### WATCHDOG[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#watchdog)

If the owner is a sentry, attackers can be spotted outside the vision arc. Add 1+ modifier to spotting (a 1 before modifiers still fails).

*House Delaque utilises numerous tools to gather secrets and pry knowledge from their surroundings, from scuttling whisper-thieves to burrowing data serpents. Among these, the Cephalopod Spektor is perhaps the most sinister, and the most effective. Each Spektor is a writhing mass of mechanical tentacles and gleaming oculi, its whirring lenses constantly tracking the shadows for movement. Via a complex array of auspexes, the Spektor drinks in its surroundings and communicates them to its owner, granting them a multi-spectral view of the battlefield. The Spektor’s cogitator is built around a fragment of synaptic tissue, grown from its owner’s genetic material. Extracted from a cloned brain gestated to the edge of adulthood, the fragment is interred into the mechanical cranium of the Spektor, and then raised to consciousness by its master. This cognitive bonding also has its drawbacks, however – a Spektor might anticipate its master’s needs, but it also often shares their hatreds or fears, making it act erratically if their owner gives in to rage or panic.*

### 0-2 PSYCHOTERIC WYRM (EXOTIC BEAST)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#0-2-psychoteric-wyrm-exotic-beast)

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |

| 6” | 4+ | 6+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4+ | 1 | 8+ | 5+ | 6+ | 8+ |

**Weapons:** Flensing knife (same as Ferocious Jaws).

**Special Rules:** Long Leash, Psychoteric Node, Burrowing.

### LONG LEASH[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#long-leash)

Must try to remain within 12" of the owner (instead of 3").

### PSYCHOTERIC NODE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#psychoteric-node)

While this pet is Active or Pinned (not Seriously Injured), the owner can channel Wyrd Powers through this fighter:

- The Psyker suffers any Perils of the Warp (as normal).
- Range, distance & LOS is measured from this pet.

### BURROWING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/#burrowing)

Move freely under impassable terrain (if movement is sufficient to pass through completely).

*Psychoteric Wyrms are disturbing creations born of dark technology and alien biology. No one save the Delaque know for sure how they are created or what gives them the semblance of life they possess, but the few examples captured by other gangs have yielded no answers – as when a dead wyrm is dissected no mechanisms or organs can be found, only an oily black fluid that reeks like the depths of the sump. In life, however, their abilities are all too terrifying to behold. Wyrms can burrow through all manner of obstacles, from ferrocrete to plasteel, or squeeze their way through the tiniest of openings, as their bodies constrict and segment with unnatural speed. This mobility makes them excellent spies for the Delaque, as there are few places they cannot travel. The connection between a Delaque and Psychoteric Wyrm is similar to that between a Delaque and one of the Spektor creations – the fighter using their `connection to the Psychoteric as well as cranial splicing to exert control over the beast.*

# DELAQUE TERRAIN

*Source: House of Shadow*

Gangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes, this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Delaque gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their battles. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s stash, and can be fielded in any game the gang plays unless noted otherwise.

## PLACING GANG TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#placing-gang-terrain)

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man’s land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

### DELAQUE TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#delaque-terrain-1)

| Terrain | Cost (Credits) | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whisperbox | 60 | Rare (10) |
| Sightblind Trap | 40 | Rare (11) |
| Shadow Veil | 50 | Rare (9) |
| Web Trap | 80 | Rare (11) |
| Euclidean Artefact | 90 | Rare (9) |

INFO

## HIDDEN TRAPS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#hidden-traps)

Some traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap’s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the battlefield. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the battlefield until they have been interacted with – this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.

## WHISPERBOX[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#whisperbox)

*Delaque gangs are often accompanied into battle by faint whispers and barely heard curses that unnerve their foes. There is nothing supernatural about this, however. It is caused by the Delaque sneaking onto the battlefield beforehand and hiding small voxcasters known as whisperboxes.*

A Whisperbox can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy’s deployment zone. While in play, all enemy fighters within 8" of the Whisperbox must apply a -1 modifier to the dice roll when making Cool checks. Though they are represented by a token or base, Whisperboxes are difficult to find and destroy. An enemy fighter in base contact with a Whisperbox may try to destroy it as a Basic action by making an Intelligence check with a -3 penalty to the dice roll. If the check is passed, the Whisperbox is destroyed.

A Whisperbox can be represented by a 25mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 25mm Necromunda base.

## SIGHTBLIND TRAP[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#sightblind-trap)

House Delaque use a variety of traps to ensnare or disable their foes, such as sightblind traps that let off intensive bursts of light and sound to confuse and disorientate enemies. A Sightblind Trap is a Hidden Trap and has the following weapon profile:

| Weapon | Rg S | Rg L | Ac S | Ac L | S | AP | D | Am | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sightblind trap | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | Blast (5"), Flash, Single Shot |

When an enemy fighter moves within 2" of a Sightblind Trap marker, they must immediately stop and the marker is flipped over. If the marker reveals a false trap, it is removed from play. If the marker reveals the real trap, it explodes immediately with the above profile. Note that when a Sightblind Trap explodes, every fighter that is touched by the Blast marker is hit.

## SHADOW VEIL[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#shadow-veil)

*Shadow veils are devices used by the Delaque to lower the surrounding light levels in an area. By absorbing photo-radiation, the small object, akin to an antenna or vox dish, causes gloom to gather around it, while the device itself is shrouded in blackness.*

A Shadow Veil can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is not within the enemy’s deployment zone. While in play, the area within 3" of the Shadow Veil is subject to the Pitch Black rules (as detailed in the Necromunda Rulebook). Note, this area also effectively blocks line of sight from one side to the other. The Shadow Veil itself can be attacked as if it were a fighter (though note, it is still in the middle of an area of Pitch Black), it has a Toughness of 4 and 1 Wound. If reduced to 0 Wounds, remove it from play (though not from the owning gang’s roster) and end its effects.

A Shadow Veil can be represented by a 25mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 25mm Necromunda base.

## WEB TRAP[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#web-trap)

House Delaque use a variety of traps to ensnare or disable their foes, these include Web Traps, designed to unleash a shower of binding webs – perfect for capturing prey that wander into their domains. A Web Trap is a Hidden Trap and has the following weapon profile:

| Weapon | Rg S | Rg L | Ac S | Ac L | S | AP | D | Am | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web trap | - | - | - | - | 5 | -2 | - | - | Blast (5"), Web, Single Shot |

When an enemy fighter moves within 2" of a Web Trap marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap as per the Hidden Traps rule. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If the marker reveals the real trap, it explodes immediately with the above profile. Note that, when a Web Trap explodes, every fighter that is touched by the Blast marker is hit.

## PSYCHOTERIC ARTEFACT (GANG RELIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/delaque-terrain#psychoteric-artefact-gang-relic)

*A Psychoteric artefact is a strange sculpture that has particular significance to the Delaque. Perhaps it represents some hero of the clan, rendered in the abstract, or maybe there are secrets hidden in its odd angles and impossible shapes. Some believe these objects represent the strange alien gods the Delaque worship, though their true purpose remains known only to the Delaque themselves.*

A Psychoteric artefact counts as a Gang Relic (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Delaque fighters that linger close by a Psychoteric artefact seem to blend into the shifting shapes of the object and are painful to look at. All friendly Delaque fighters within 6" of the Psychoteric artefact count as being in full cover.

Delaque gangs can only include a Psychoteric artefact if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender.

A Psychoteric artefact can be represented by a 40mm marker or a piece of terrain modelled on a 40mm Necromunda base.

# PSYCHOTERIC WHISPERS

*Source: House of Shadow*

A Delaque’s ability to subvert reality goes far beyond the spreading of simple mistruths and rumours. The most accomplished of their kind can tap into the Psychoterica generated by their brothers and sisters, and channel it into lies so potent that they can shift a sentient being’s perception of their surroundings. To deliver these lies, the Delaque must get close, often leaning in to whisper in the ear of their intended victim, but the effects can be dramatic. With a psychoteric whisper, they can make their enemies see friends as foes, think their weapons have failed them, or even become blind to the presence of the Delaque.

Psychoteric Whispers are special short ranged psychic abilities possessed by certain Delaque. Much like skills they enhance the abilities of a fighter in specific ways and can be employed by using actions, most often with an enemy fighter as the target. Psychoteric Whispers are, in effect, psychic powers and use the rules for manifesting, disrupting and maintaining Wyrd Powers found in the Necromunda Rulebook.

## MASTERY OF LIES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#mastery-of-lies)

To use Psychoteric Whispers, a Delaque fighter must first be upgraded to become a Psyker. Only a Master of Shadow or Phantom may be upgraded in this way – note that Psy-Gheists may also make use of these powers as they are already Psykers when added to the gang. Fighters can either be upgraded to become Psykers during gang creation, or by spending XP later on:

- A Delaque Master of Shadow or Phantom may be upgraded to become a Psyker when added to a gang roster for a cost of 30 credits (this increases their credits value accordingly). The fighter gains both the Psychoteric Mastery and Non-sanctioned Psyker special rules (as follows).
- A Delaque Master of Shadow or Phantom may be upgraded to become a Psyker by taking an advance at a cost of 7 XP (this increases their credits value by +30). The fighter gains both the Psychoteric Mastery and Non-sanctioned Psyker special rules (as follows).

**Psychoteric Mastery:** A fighter with this special rule is a Psyker, as described in the Necromunda Rulebook, and is able to use Psychoteric Whispers. The fighter must choose one discipline (Madness, Delusion or Darkness) to specialise in and may immediately select a single Wyrd Power from that discipline to know.

During Campaign play, this fighter may gain additional Wyrd Powers from their chosen discipline in exactly the same way as they might gain a Primary Skill (i.e., by spending 6 XP to gain a random Wyrd Power, or by spending 9 XP to choose a Wyrd Power).

**Non-sanctioned Psyker:** Should a fighter with this special rule be taken Out of Action, the enemy gang is rewarded a bounty of D3x10 credits at the end of the battle. Should a fighter with this special rule be captured and sold to the Guilders, they are worth their full value.

INFO

## PSYCHOTERIC CHOIRS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#psychoteric-choirs)

All Delaque share a link to the Psychoterica and, even if they are not skilled in the use of Psychoteric Whispers, can aid those that are. When a Delaque fighter (including House Agent Hired Guns, Hangers-on and Brutes) uses a Psychoteric Whisper, its potency will be increased for every friendly Delaque fighter that is within 3" of them, is Standing and is not Engaged, as the other Delaque join in with hissing whispers under their breath. Each eligible Delaque fighter within this range will increase the range of the Psychoteric Whisper by 1" (to a maximum of +3").

In addition, the Psychoteric Whisper will be harder to resist, and any Intelligence check made to resist the Psychoteric Whisper must reduce the result of the dice roll by 1 for each friendly Delaque fighter within 3" of the whisperer (to a maximum of 3).

## MADNESS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#madness)

*The psychoteric discipline of Madness is the psychic mastery of fear and insanity, and those skilled in its use can make those who hear their whispers lose all rational thought. At its most simple, it instils panic and indecisiveness in those it touches, but a skilled psyker can expand it even further, until the world breaks down around their victims, leaving only a realm of darkness and terror from which there can be no escape.*

### 1. EXISTENTIAL BARRAGE (SIMPLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#1-existential-barrage-simple)

Choose a single enemy fighter that is within 1" of the Psyker. That fighter immediately makes an Intelligence check. If this check is failed, they become Broken and immediately flee. If, after they have moved, there are any fighters friendly to them within 5", those fighters must also immediately pass a Nerve test or also become Broken.

### 2. TERRIBLE TRUTHS (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#2-terrible-truths-basic)

Choose a single enemy fighter that is within 3" of the Psyker. That fighter must make an Intelligence check. If this check is failed, they gain the Insane condition.

### 3. PSYCHOTIC LURE (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#3-psychotic-lure-basic)

Choose a single enemy fighter that currently has a Ready marker and is within 3" of the Psyker. The opposing player must activate that fighter in their next turn. The chosen fighter cannot perform a Group Activation when next activated.

### 4. CYCLOPEAN GAZE (DOUBLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#4-cyclopean-gaze-double)

Choose a single enemy fighter that currently has a Ready marker and is within 1" of the Psyker. The chosen fighter immediately loses their Ready Marker.

### 5. CRAVEN HOWL (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#5-craven-howl-basic-continuous-effect)

While this power is maintained, Broken enemy fighters cannot attempt to Rally whilst within 5" of the Psyker.

### 6. UNREMEMBERABLE UTTERANCE (SIMPLE), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#6-unrememberable-utterance-simple-continuous-effect)

While this power is maintained, all enemy fighters who activate whilst within 3" of the Psyker can only perform one action, rather than the usual two (note that this means the fighter will be unable to perform a Double action).

## DELUSION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#delusion)

*Reality is a mutable substance, as psykers skilled in the psychoteric discipline of Delusion well know. Eyes and ears can be made to betray their owners, and even once-trusted allies can seem as enemies should the psyker’s powers do their work. Even an enemy’s own flesh can be turned against them with this power, their mind making phantasmal horrors into terrible reality.*

### 1. SPATIAL PSYCHOSIS (SIMPLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#1-spatial-psychosis-simple)

Choose a single enemy fighter within 12" of the Psyker, that is Standing and is not Engaged. That fighter immediately becomes Pinned. Note that if that fighter is within ½" of the edge of a ledge or platform, this may cause them to fall.

### 2. SEEN UNSEEN (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#2-seen-unseen-basic-continuous-effect)

Choose a single enemy fighter that is within 3" of the Psyker. While this power is maintained, the chosen fighter treats all fighters as being enemy fighters, and all fighters treat the chosen fighter as being an enemy fighter. Note that this means any rule, special or otherwise, that affects friendly fighters or friendly faction fighters ceases to work for the chosen fighter whilst this power is maintained as the chosen fighter has no friendly fighters of any sort on the battlefield.

### 3. GHOST AND SHADOW (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#3-ghost-and-shadow-basic)

Choose a single enemy fighter that is within 10" of the Psyker. The Psyker’s controlling player may immediately change this fighter’s facing (in other words, they may turn the model to face any direction).

### 4. DECEITFUL THOUGHTS (DOUBLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#4-deceitful-thoughts-double)

Choose a single enemy fighter that is within 5" of the Psyker. That fighter immediately makes an Intelligence check. If this check is failed, the Psyker’s controlling player may immediately move that fighter up to their Move characteristic in any direction. Note that this move may not be used to move enemy fighters off ledges, into dangerous terrain or any other part of the battlefield harmful to them.

### 5. SUICIDAL EMBRACE (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#5-suicidal-embrace-basic)

Choose a single enemy fighter that is within 3" of the Psyker. That fighter immediately makes an Intelligence check. If this check is failed, that fighter must resolve a single close combat attack against themselves with one of their Melee weapons (chosen at random, if the fighter has no weapons with the Melee trait, they will make an unarmed attack against themselves). This attack automatically hits, but must roll to wound and inflict Damage as normal.

### 6. OPPROBRIOUS CURSE (SIMPLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#6-opprobrious-curse-simple)

Choose a single enemy fighter that is within 3" of the Psyker. That fighter immediately makes a Toughness check. If this check is failed, the fighter immediately suffers a Flesh Wound.

## DARKNESS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#darkness)

*Darkness is a powerful ally for those with the skill to shape it. In the underhive, shadows are plentiful and offer protection for hunters and hunted alike, though for those skilled in the psychoteric discipline of Darkness, they offer a special advantage. With the power of their minds, they can wrap themselves in this blackness, using it to conceal themselves in the open or bring down blinding darkness upon their enemies.*

### 1. CACOPHONY OF SILENCE (DOUBLE), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#1-cacophony-of-silence-double-continuous-effect)

While this power is maintained, all enemy fighters within 5" of the Psyker must re-roll successful Hit rolls when making a ranged attack.

### 2. PENUMBRAL MIRROR (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#2-penumbral-mirror-basic)

Choose one enemy fighter and one friendly fighter that are both currently within 5" of the Psyker. Immediately move the chosen friendly fighter to any other point within 5" of the chosen enemy fighter. The chosen friendly fighter may even move into base contact with the chosen enemy fighter.

### 3. A PERFECT VOID (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#3-a-perfect-void-basic-continuous-effect)

While this power is maintained, the Psyker counts as being in full cover to all enemy fighters within 10".

### 4. ETERNAL SLUMBER (DOUBLE)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#4-eternal-slumber-double)

All Seriously Injured enemy fighters within 3" of the Psyker immediately go Out of Action.

### 5. CLOAK OF WHISPERS (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#5-cloak-of-whispers-basic-continuous-effect)

While this power is maintained, the Psyker and all friendly Delaque fighters within 3" of them cannot be the target of, or be affected by, any gang tactics played by the enemy player.

### 6. SIGHT BLIGHT (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-delaque/psychoteric-wyrd-powers#6-sight-blight-basic-continuous-effect)

While this power is maintained, all enemy fighters within 5" of the Psyker count as being affected by the Pitch Black rules as detailed in the Necromunda Rulebook. Note that this does not actually create an area of darkness and only affects those who enter or remain in range of the Psyker.

# HOUSE ESCHER

*At once ancient and youthful, the House of Escher has endured far longer than any other Clan House of Necromunda. Under one name or another, they can trace their lineage back to the age of Martek Helm’ayr, the first Lord Helmawr, and, it is rumoured, even beyond that. Few now know of the early centuries of House Escher, the past of the clan hidden behind ritual and history. Rather, they are seen as what they have become: a matriarchy built upon a throne of chems and violence. These are the pillars of what it means to be Escher, a drive to prove their strength through skill at arms and reckless aggression, fuelled by a chemical empire that mixes Imperial science with pagan ritual. To outsiders, Eschers are cruel and deadly warriors, a perfection of the female fighter on Necromunda. Their gangs stalk the underhive alongside strange and exotic beasts, the mere touch of their weapons enough to corrupt blood or set a victim’s nerves on fire. Above these youthful and energetic gang warriors toils a House more prosperous than any on Necromunda – all women born beneath the beneficent smile of a Clan Chymist equal in the eyes of the Matriarch Primus and her Council of Crones. Thus may an Escher prove herself no matter the manner or place of her birthand, should she do well in the concoction of chems, therearing of xenos beasts, or fighting for the clan in the endless inter-House wars, she may well rise up to join the council herself – or perhaps even don the mantle of Matriarch Primus.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/#gang-composition)

House Escher follows the [normal rules](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.

## SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/#special-rules)

Follow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:

- [Chem-alchemy Elixir](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy): A gang visiting the Trading post during the post-battle sequence can buy any number of doses (Common).
- Fighters promoted to Champion can only become a Matriarch, not a Death-Maiden.
- Death-Maidens do not have Group Activation (1).

*It takes a lot of ruthlessness and no small talent for violence to be a Gang Queen. Those who rise to lead one of House Escher’s underhive gangs are, without exception, skilled killers and charismatic leaders, able to inspire their girls not with empty words and promises, but bloody deeds and sheer audacity. Of course the life of a Gang Queen is seldom a long one. As any Escher will tell you: the cost of living life on the edge is that eventually you fall over it.*

**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).

*Gang Matriarchs are drawn from the craziest, wildest and most homicidal of the Gang Queen’s girls, each one a natural killer. Favouring even more outlandish dress than most Escher, and carrying the deadliest weapons they can lay their hands on, a Matriarch is both gang enforcer, underhive assassin and debutant of death all rolled into one. It is no surprise then, that should the Gang Queen fall, it is one of the Matriarchs who will inevitably take her place as mistress of the gang.*

*All Escher adolescents grow up in the Wyld, learning everything they need to know about hive life free from the oppressive societies practised by most other Clan Houses. As they come of age, they become responsible women and take up their preordained role within the clan – or, at least, most do. Some become Wyld Runners; reckless and bold underhive explorers and beast wranglers, eventually joining the House gangs or forming their own crews of Wyld Runners and their venomous hunting Phelynx.*

*House Escher has a long and somewhat shadowy history in dealing in off-world life forms. It is well known that they make extensive use of strange and exotic creatures to fuel their pharmaceutical production, and the fact that it provides the raw materials for their outlandish costumes appears to be a fortuitous by-product. Most of these xenos life forms come the House’s way legally, through sanctioned trade with the Noble Houses of the upper spires and long-standing contracts and permits allow House Escher ready access to the segmentum’s most illustrious pedigree beast breeders.*

*More disturbingly, perhaps, is the fact that House Escher runs a dark and hidden trade in the creation of new life from the creatures they deal in. Gene-spliced hybrids, flesh-fused chimerae and other, darker fusions of different species are commonly created. Provided that House Escher continues to avoid the use of intelligent xenos life in their experimentation, the Imperial House continues to turn a blind eye, and so these dumb monstrosities are produced and sold to the gladiatoria to entertain the crowds, kept as attack beasts to guard and protect Escher holdings, and quite often make their way into the ranks of particularly well renown Escher gangs, where they add considerably to the status of Leaders and Champions.*

- 2 Strength to any falling damage.

*House Escher has a long tradition of dealing in many strange and exotic off-worldcreatures. At its most basic, this trade in xenos fauna helps to fuel many of theHouse’s unique elixirs and forms no small part of the basis for its trade and expertisein alchemical technology. A side effect of this prodigious, and often illicit, tradeinxenos lifeforms, is that House Escher has access to the pelts and plumage of manywonderful beasts, and this is clearly evidenced in the Escher style of dress. It is alsonot uncommon for House Escher to bring onto Necromunda the creatures that featurein the fighting pits and gladiatoria, a trade, which in turn, enables the House toset up ever more contacts amongst the many big game hunters and Rogue Traders that specialise in such commodities.*

*However, not all off-world beasts are destined for the Escher laboratoria or thefightingpits of Necromunda, some creatures are prized as companions, especially thevariousfelids that originate on many different worlds. Escher gangers are attracted to thebigcats of Phyrr in particular for their exotic looks and killer instincts. Such beasts arerare in the extreme and smuggling them planetside to Hive Primus is no meanfeat, sothey are an incredibly rare sight as pets even amongst the hierarchy of HouseEscher. Yet seen they are, and when the opportunity to acquire such a beast, or even better, amating pair, arises, Escher gang queens will go to any lengths to secure them.*

### UNTAMED[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/#untamed)

All attacks have Reckless (only has unarmed attack).

*House Escher has created countless gene-smithed felinoid creatures. One of the most successful is the Phelynx, or Venom Cat. A mix of reptilian biology and Phyrr Cat genes, it is an excellent hunting beast. Phelynx are used almost exclusively by the Wyld, the Runners driving entire packs of the creatures before them into battle. As their name implies, a Venom Cat’s bite can be deadly, its neuro-toxic venom able to incapacitate or kill in moments. Wyld Runners routinely apply Phelynx venom to their weapons, while some even imbibe it in small doses to build up a resistance to the toxins. Venom Cats are also naturally stealthy beasts and, like the Wyld Runners themselves, are masters of ambush. Part of this stealth comes from the creature’s instinctive grace and speed, the rest from its unique biology. Unlike Phyrr Cats, Phelynx are coldblooded, their bio-signs barely registering at all, making them extremely difficultto spot with auspexes.*

*The bond between Phelynx and Wyld Runner is one built over a lifetime. When an Escher juve joins the Wyld, she will be given a weapon to master or a pet to train – this often coming in the form of an infant Phelynx. Over years of hunting and battle the Escher and beast become inseparable, one able to anticipate and coordinate with the actions of the other in a way no two human gangers could ever hope to match.*

# ESCHER CHEM-ALCHEMY

*Source: House of Blades*

House Escher gangs benefit from the prodigious output of the clan’s Chymist Cults. All manner of stimms, chems and toxins are available to Gang Queens and their fighters, enhancing their natural abilities and making even the slightest scratch of their stiletto knives and swords exceptionally deadly. In addition to the standard selection of chems, toxins and poisonous gases available on Necromunda, House Escher gangs can buy speciality concoctions and compounds from those detailed below.

## USING CHEM-ALCHEMY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#using-chem-alchemy)

When an Escher gang visits the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence, they can buy a Chem-alchemy Elixir in the Purchase Equipment step. Chem-alchemy Elixirs are considered to be part of the gang’s House Equipment List, and so do not require a Seek Rare Equipment roll to be purchased.

When a gang buys a Chem-alchemy Elixir, they must decide what kind of chem (Stimm, Toxic Ammo or Gaseous Ammo) it will be, and what its effects will be. This is done when it is purchased, and will affect its final cost. Creating a Chem-alchemy Elixir is done using the following steps:

- Choose a chem type either: Stimm, Toxic Ammo or Gaseous Ammo
- Choose up to three effects from the chosen chem’s effect list
- Add up the credit cost of each effect to find the final cost of the chem

Each time a chem is bought, regardless of the number of effects it includes, it represents a single dose or application.

A dose or application lasts for the duration of a single battle (unless otherwise noted) then it is used up and removed from the gang’s stash.

## STIMMS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#stimms)

Stimms are beneficial chems fighters use to heal themselves, enhance their fighting abilities, or protect themselves against poisons and other perils. A stimm counts as Wargear. A fighter can start a battle under the effects of any stimm they are equipped with if they choose, or can administer that stimm during a battle to themselves or a friendly fighter in base contact by performing an **Administer Dose (Simple)** action during their activation.

| Stimm Effects | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Bad Blood | 10 |
| Blood Rush | 15 |
| Brain Lock | 15 |
| Dreamland | 10 |
| Hyper | 20 |
| Ice Cold | 15 |
| Jolt | 30 |
| Night Night | 25 |
| Puke | 15 |
| Wide-eye | 10 |

### BAD BLOOD[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#bad-blood)

*This stimm contains genophaic haem-mimics that modify the subject’s haemoglobin. The result is to make the blood highly toxic to all but the carrier, ensuring a single drop is enough to kill if it comes into contact with another fighter.*

**Effect:** When a fighter under the effects of this chem suffers one or more Wounds and/ or Flesh Wounds, all fighters in base contact with them must make an Initiative check. If this check is failed, they are considered to have taken a hit from a weapon with the Toxin trait.

### BLOOD RUSH[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#blood-rush)

*Created from a collection of plasmid-modified cells, Blood Rush rapidly knits together torn flesh and thereby stops bleeding.*

**Effect:** When this stimm is administered to a fighter, that fighter may remove a single Flesh Wound or immediately recover from being Seriously Injured.

### BRAIN LOCK[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#brain-lock)

Psychoactive stimms fill the fighter’s brain, allowing them to disrupt malign energies in the area around them by strength of will.

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm counts as a Psyker for the purposes of disrupting enemy psychic powers (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook).

### DREAMLAND[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#dreamland)

*The neural blockers contained in this stimm interfere with receptors associated with harmful thoughts that might otherwise affect the fighter.*

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm ignores the effects of the Insane condition.

### HYPER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#hyper)

*Cortical-kinetic impellers energise the motive pathways of the fighter’s body, giving them thought-quick movements and blinding reflexes.*

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm increases their Movement characteristic by 2, and, when they take the Charge (Double) Action, they add D6" to their movement rather than D3". This increased level of hyper-activity makes them exceptionally twitchy, and they must reduce all their hit rolls by 1.

### ICE COLD[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#ice-cold)

*Created from strains of Kalma and Spur, this stimm dulls reality without deadening the senses or making the subject docile.*

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm adds 2 to any Cool checks they are required to make.

### JOLT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#jolt)

*A blast of powerful stimulants floods the fighter’s body, allowing them to shrug off their injuries and get back into the fight – at least until the chems wear off.*

**Effect:** Until the end of the round in which this stimm was administered, a fighter under the effects of this stimm counts any Serious Injuries they suffer as Flesh Wounds.

### NIGHT NIGHT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#night-night)

*Sometimes the only way to keep death at bay is to have a good sleep. Night Night uses bio-anaesthesitics to put the subject into a healing coma.*

**Effect:** When a fighter under the effects of this stimm goes Out of Action, do not roll for a Lasting Injury. Instead, the fighter counts as having rolled a result of 12-26 Out Cold on the Lasting Injury table. Note that the fighter may still be captured as normal.

### PUKE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#puke)

*This stimm pumps potent counter-toxins into the fighter’s system, the tiny microbes purging any foreign agents introduced into their bloodstream.*

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm doubles their Toughness when testing to see if they are affected by weapons with the Toxin or Gas traits.

### WIDE-EYE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#wide-eye)

*The chem contains ocular stimulants that expand the subject’s pupils and sharpens their mind so they are capable of noticing even the minutest of details.*

**Effect:** A fighter under the effects of this stimm ignores the effects of the Pitch Black rules. In addition, if the fighter is a Sentry in a battle using the Sneak Attack rules (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook) then they always count enemy fighters as being ‘in the open’.

## GASEOUS AMMO[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#gaseous-ammo)

This includes all manner of collected poisonous chemicals and vapours carefully sorted and stored by the Chymist Cults. Their effects can range from knocking a victim out to driving them insane with wild hallucinations, blinding them, or even burning through respirators.

A fighter equipped with Gaseous Ammo can apply its effects to any weapon they are equipped with that has the Gas trait during the pre-battle sequence, once crews have been selected.

Once applied to a weapon with the Gas trait, Gaseous Ammo will change the profile and Traits of the weapon as noted in the appropriate entry for the duration of that battle. Their effects expire during the Wrap-up.

| Gas Effects | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Acidic | 20 |
| Bane | 15 |
| Blackout | 30 |
| Blinding | 10 |
| Expansive | 20 |
| Hallucinogen | 15 |
| Leaden | 30 |
| Liftin’ | 25 |
| Pathogenic | 15 |
| Pyrophoric | 20 |

### ACIDIC[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#acidic)

*Caustic compounds within the gas eat away at filters and seals, making a mockery of respirators and hazard suits. However, such gases, while able to work their way through such defences, are not as lethal as true biopathic toxins.*

**Effect:** A fighter hit by a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied does not benefit from armour or Wargear that would normally increase their Toughness against weapons with the Gas trait (i.e., respirators). Out of Action results on the Injury dice generated by hits from a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied count as Seriously Injured results instead.

### BANE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#bane)

*Some chemical compounds are designed to specifically attack the weakest points on ponderous machines or massive creatures, working their way into eyes, mouths and organs that might otherwise be protected from conventional weapons.*

**Effect:** A fighter hit by a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied counts their Toughness as 3, regardless of their actual Toughness characteristic. Note that Wargear such as a respirator can still modify the fighter’s Toughness against Gas weapons as normal.

### BLACKOUT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#blackout)

*Blackout contains potent flurane chems. These are powerful mixtures of knockout drugs and the slightest whiff can render a fighter instantly unconscious.*

**Effect:** If a fighter suffers a Serious Injury from a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, they are taken Out of Action, just as if they had rolled an Out of Action result. Fighters taken Out of Action by a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied do not need to roll on the Lasting Injury table. Instead, the fighter counts as having rolled a result of 12-26 Out Cold on the Lasting Injury table.

### BLINDING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#blinding)

*Bio-adhesives in Blinding gas infiltrate the victim’s eyes, restricting their blood flow to rob them of their sight. Though these debilitating effects are short lived, they often last long enough for the victim’s enemies to finish them off.*

**Effect:** A fighter that suffers a Flesh Wound from a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied becomes subject to the Blind condition until the End phase of the current round.

### EXPANSIVE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#expansive)

*Helio-molecular stimulation of toxic gases allows Expansive gas to disperse over an extremely large area.*

**Effect:** This Gaseous Ammo can only be applied to a weapon that has both the Gas and Blast (X") traits. When placing a Blast marker generated by a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, a fighter may place one more Blast marker than normal. This marker must be placed so that it is touching at least one other Blast marker generated by this weapon.

### HALLUCINOGEN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#hallucinogen)

*Hallucinogen gases contain aggressive psychogenic chems that attack the subject’s mind and make them doubt their own senses.*

**Effect:** A fighter hit by a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied must make a Willpower check in addition to the Toughness check to resist the effects of being hit by a weapon with the Gas trait. If this Willpower check is failed, the fighter immediately becomes subject to the Insane condition.

### LEADEN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#leaden)

*Leaden gases are incredibly dense, causing bursts to settle upon the battlefield and increase their dispersal time.*

**Effect:** After resolving an attack using a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, place a 3" Blast marker so that its central hole is within the area of the Flame template or Blast marker placed when making the attack.

Any fighters that move through this Blast marker count as being hit by the weapon that made this attack (work out this hit when the fighter ends their current action). This Blast marker remains in play until the End phase of the current round.

### LIFTIN’[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#liftin)

*Liftin’ gases have had their composition altered, decreasing their density without sacrificing their potency, allowing them to be sprayed further from weapons such as chem throwers.*

**Effect:** This Gaseous Ammo can only be applied to a weapon that has both the Gas and Template traits. When making an attack using a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, the template may be placed up to 6" away from the fighter making the attack. When placing the template, it must be positioned so the narrow end points directly towards the fighter making the attack. The wide end of the template must be the furthest part of the template from the fighter.

### PATHOGENIC[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#pathogenic)

*There are many kinds of microbic chems that induce rapid necrosis in human flesh, and the Chymist Cults are adept at weaponising many of them. Pathogenics can quickly kill their victim if a counter-agent is not deployed in time.*

**Effect:** After a fighter is hit by a weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied, place a marker next to them. At the start of that fighter’s next activation, roll a D6. On a 3+, immediately remove this marker. On a roll of 1 or 2, the fighter immediately suffers the effects of the Gas trait, just as if they had been hit by the same weapon again.

### PYROPHORIC[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#pyrophoric)

*Pyrophoric gases are particularly insidious, clinging to their targets for extended periods of time and remaining self-fuelling in their immolation.*

**Effect:** A weapon with the Gas trait with this Gaseous Ammo applied gains the Blaze trait.

## TOXIC AMMO[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#toxic-ammo)

The toxins used by the Chymist Cults are virulent poisons and the most extreme kinds of weaponised chemicals. Their effects can range from causing wounds that won’t stop bleeding to driving their victims into a killing frenzy, from relentlessly attacking their system to even causing their organs to explode!

A fighter equipped with a Toxic Ammo can apply its effects to any weapon they are equipped with that has the Toxin trait during the pre-battle sequence, once crews have been selected.

Once applied to a weapon with the Toxin trait, Toxic Ammo will change the profile and traits of the weapon as noted in the appropriate entry for the duration of that battle. Their effects expire during the Wrap-up.

| Toxin Effects | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Bleeding | 10 |
| Concentrated | 15 |
| Debilitating | 10 |
| Decaying | 5 |
| Exploding | 20 |
| Maddening | 5 |
| Maiming | 10 |
| Panicking | 10 |
| Paralysing | 5 |
| Silencing | 5 |

### BLEEDING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#bleeding)

*Anticoagulant compounds are laced into the toxin, causing wounds to bleed freely once inflicted.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter card. At the beginning of each End phase, each of these markers is removed and replaced with a Flesh Wound.

### CONCENTRATED[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#concentrated)

*Concentrated toxins have a short-lived potency, but are highly effective at delivering a strong dose of poison right into the heart of their victims.*

**Effect:** The first time a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied hits an enemy fighter, add 2 to the dice roll to see if it overcomes the fighter’s Toughness. Note that this Toxic Ammo only affects this weapon’s first successful hit, and any subsequent hits, even during the same action, will be worked out as normal.

### DEBILITATING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#debilitating)

*Debilitating toxins can cause blindness, partial paralysis, or enfeeblement.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter card. For each marker on their Fighter card, a fighter must subtract 1 from any Characteristic checks they are required to make. At the end of the battle, or if the fighter goes Out of Action, remove these markers from their Fighter card.

### DECAYING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#decaying)

*Necrotic acids are used to create toxins that can not only poison living organisms but also eat away at armour making their victims more vulnerable to further harm.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out of Action, place a marker on their Fighter card. For each marker on their Fighter card, a fighter must subtract 1 from any Save rolls they are required to make. At the end of the battle, or if the fighter goes Out of Action, remove these markers from their Fighter card.

### EXPLODING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#exploding)

*The hexaphagic venoms in explosive toxins attack their victims at a cellular level, literally expanding their organs until they explode in a shower of blood and gore.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is taken Out of Action by a hit from a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, before removing them from the battlefield place a 3" Blast marker over that fighter, with the marker’s hole centred on their base. All fighters touched by this Blast marker suffer an immediate hit as if from a weapon with the Gas trait.

### MADDENING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#maddening)

*Psycho-conductive chems make Maddening poisons not only potentially deadly but are also capable of driving their victims into a frenzied rage.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, for the remainder of the battle all their attacks gain the Reckless trait.

### MAIMING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#maiming)

*Maiming toxins are filled with nano-caustic chems that tear the victim’s body apart from the inside, leaving savage, lasting wounds even if they survive the poison’s initial effects.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is taken Out of Action by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, the opposing player may roll twice on the Lasting Injuries table and choose which of the two results to apply.

### PANICKING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#panicking)

*Even a small drop of these kinds of nerve agents can send uncontrollable flesh quakes through a victim’s muscles, sending their heart racing and their mind spiralling into a pit of terror and despair.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, they immediately become Broken, as if they had failed a Nerve test.

### PARALYSING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#paralysing)

*Cortical inhibitors are common medicae chems used to keep patients still during surgeries. When mixed with deadly poisons, they ensure that should the target live through the effects of the toxins they will be going nowhere.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, they must immediately make a Strength check or become Paralysed. A Paralysed fighter counts as being subject to the Webbed condition.

### SILENCING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#silencing)

*Silencing toxins contain chemicals that target the victim’s vocal organs and auditory senses, effectively isolating them from the world around them.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, for the remainder of the round they cannot issue or be part of Group Activations.

### NAMING YOUR CHEMS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#naming-your-chems)

Part of the fun of creating your own chems and poisons is coming up with names for them! Players are encouraged to experiment combining the effects provided to find the concoction that is right for their gang. For example, a poisonous Gas combining Acidic, Blinding and Pyrophoric traits might be known as Eyebite Gas, while one with the Expansive and Liftin’ traits could be known on the streets as Khimerix Breath. With the Arbitrator’s permission, in a campaign an Escher gang might even concoct these poisons and sell them to other gangs, creating their own clandestine trade in stimms, chem weapons and toxic blades.

## HOUSE OF GILDED GRACE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#house-of-gilded-grace)

NOTE

### DESIGNER’S COMMENTARY: NEW RULES FOR HOUSE ESCHER GANGS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#designers-commentary-new-rules-for-house-escher-gangs)

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in [Apocrypha Necromunda: Queen of Ash Town](https://www.warhammer-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LY6kk10sz3uV0hmQ.pdf), as well as new options for House Escher gangs. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used during a campaign.

*Source: Apocrypha Necromunda: Queens of Ash Town*

If your gang includes an Apprentice Clan Chymist, then the following may be purchased as Chem-alchemy Elixirs. Note that unlike other Chem-alchemy Elixirs, these may not be combined with other chems and an Apprentice Clan Chymist does not reduce their credit cost.

### BLOOD BOIL (TOXIC AMMO)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#blood-boil-toxic-ammo)

**+30 Credits**

*Blood Boil is a deadly concoction of Esmer Tul’s own devising. It causes a victim’s organs to rupture and destroy themselves whilst driving them mad with agony.*

**Effect:** Whenever a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied hits an enemy fighter, add 1 to the dice roll to see if it overcomes the fighter’s Toughness. In addition, the weapon has the Exploding and Maddening Toxin Effects applied to it.

### SKIN FIRE (TOXIC AMMO)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#skin-fire-toxic-ammo)

**+25 Credits**

*Skin Fire is a vicious chem that upon contact with a person’s skin changes the chemistry of their blood so that it becomes extremely flammable, whilst the area around the wound blackens and decays.*

**Effect:** If a fighter is Injured by a weapon with the Toxin trait with this Toxic Ammo applied, and is not taken Out of Action, roll a D6; on a 4+ the fighter becomes subject to the Blaze condition. In addition, the weapon has the Debilitating and Decaying Toxin Effects applied to it.

### PREDATOR’S KISS (STIMM)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/chem-alchemy#predators-kiss-stimm)

**+45 Credits**

*A potent mix, Predator’s Kiss combines the Blood Rush and Hyper stimms with Esmer Tul’s own addition distilled from the pheromone glands of Phelynx. The result burns away a fighter’s fatigue, replacing it with a burning strength and a desire to do great violence.*

**Effect:** A fighter under the effect of this Stimm adds 1 to their Strength characteristic for the purposes of close combat attacks, though all of their weapons gain the Reckless trait. In addition, they have the Blood Rush and Hyper Stimm Effects applied to them.

# ESCHER TERRAIN

*Source: House of Blades*

Gangs often make cunning use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Escher gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang plays unless noted otherwise.

## PLACING GANG TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#placing-gang-terrain)

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man’s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

### ESCHER TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#escher-terrain-1)

| Terrain | Cost (Credits) | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blade Cages | 50 | Rare (9) |
| Decapitators | 75 | Rare (11) |
| Gas Canisters | 15 | Common |
| Gas Censers | 50 | Rare (10) |
| Chymist Cult Relic | 100 | Rare (10) |

INFO

### HIDDEN TRAPS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#hidden-traps)

Some traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap’s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the board. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the board until they have been interacted with – this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.

## GAS CANISTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#gas-canisters)

Escher gas canisters are homemade containers for the gang’s toxic compounds or airborne chems. In battle, a ganger can tap one of these makeshift containers to reload their gas weapons or give them an extra boost. The danger of having so much poisonous gas in one place, of course, is if a stray round ruptures them, they can saturate an area in toxins, killing friend and foe alike.

Gas Canisters can be represented by a marker, or an appropriate model placed on a 25mm base. Gas Canisters can be moved in the same manner as Loot caskets (see the Necromunda Rulebook). A friendly fighter within 1" of a Gas Canister can use it as if it were chem-synth, increasing the lethality of their Gas weapons. Note that unlike a normal chem-synth, a Gas Canister can only be used to enhance weapons with the Gas trait.

Gas Canisters can be targeted by ranged attacks just as if they were fighters, and may be affected by Blast and Template weapons if they are touched by a Blast marker or Template marker. Gas Canisters have a Toughness of 3, and if they take any damage are destroyed and removed from the battlefield. When a Gas Canister is destroyed, place a 3" Blast marker over its position before removing it from the battlefield. All fighters touched by this marker take a hit from a weapon with the Gas trait.

## BLADE CAGES (TRAP)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#blade-cages-trap)

Blade Cages are cruel but effective mantraps. With pressure plates or tripwires to set them off, they are bladed claws that rise up from the ground or descend from the ceiling to envelop their victims. Those caught in a Blade Cage are left with the unenviable task of trying to struggle free, hoping they don’t cut themselves to pieces in the process.

Blade Cages are Traps, and use the Hidden Traps rules. Blade Cages can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.

When an enemy fighter moves within 2" of a Blade Cage marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap as per the Hidden Traps rule. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, the fighter is moved into base contact with the marker and gains the Webbed condition. As long as a Blade Cage has trapped a fighter, it cannot trap additional fighters, and fighters moving past it do not need to make Initiative checks to see if they are caught.

Blade Cages can be removed by performing the Disarm (Basic) Action and passing an Intelligence check, while within 1" of the marker. If this check is failed, the fighter becomes trapped as detailed above.

## DECAPITATORS (TRAP)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#decapitators-trap)

Decapitators are far less subtle versions of Blade Cages. Using spring-loaded or pneumatic driven blades, they make for savage and messy booby traps.

Decapitators are Traps and use the Hidden Traps rules. Decapitators can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.

When an enemy fighter moves within 2" of a Decapitator marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, the fighter must immediately roll an Injury dice and apply the results.

Decapitators can be removed by performing the Disarm (Basic) Action and passing an Intelligence check, while within 1" of the marker. If this check is failed, the fighter must roll an Injury dice as detailed above.

## GAS CENSERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#gas-censers)

Gas Censers hung from domes or doorways slowly release toxins into the air. They can be represented by either a marker or a piece of terrain on a 25mm base. Gas Censers can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.

In the End phase, a fighter within 3" of a Gas Censer must make a Toughness check, adding any bonuses to the roll for Wargear and armour that protects against weapons with the Gas trait. If this check is failed, or the roll was a 6, the fighter suffers an immediate Flesh Wound.

Gas Censers can be thrown by a friendly fighter in base contact with them, just as if they were a grenade. Work out this attack as normal, counting the Gas Censer as a Choke Gas grenade. Once the attack has been worked out, remove the marker from the battlefield.

## CHYMIST CULT RELIC (GANG RELIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-escher/escher-terrain#chymist-cult-relic-gang-relic)

House Escher gang relics are altars to the Chymist Cults. Whether they are massive bladed icons of the House, or spiked pillars hung with the trophies of the gang’s kills, they incorporate chem-stills and toxin filters. A Chymist Cult Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, a friendly fighter within 3" of a Chymist Cult Relic can use it as if it were chem-synth, increasing the lethality of their Gas and Toxin weapons. Seriously Injured friendly fighters within 3" of a Chymist Cult Relic count as being assisted by a friendly fighter making Recovery rolls.

Enemy fighters who end their activation within 3" of a Chymist Cult Relic must make a Toughness check, adding any bonuses to the roll for Wargear and armour that protects against weapons with the Gas trait, or immediately suffer a Flesh Wound.

Escher gangs can only include a Chymist Cult Relic if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. A Chymist Cult Relic can be represented by an appropriate marker or a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain, painted in the colours of the gang and hung with Escher icons.

Note that if the relic is defiled (see the Necromunda Rulebook), it loses the bonuses it provides to Cool and Leadership checks, but retains its other benefits.

# HOUSE GOLIATH

*Source: House of Chains*

*Strength is all for House Goliath. Without the physical strength to dominate rivals or to endure the hardships of Necromunda, a Goliath is nothing. They were created as a slave race to work the refineries and forges of Necromunda and toil in places where even hardy Necromundans could not survive, and while the members of the clan are practically abhuman in their size and strength, only fools underestimate their resourcefulness and low cunning. It was the folly of their creators, who believed the Goliaths could be kept docile and ignorant though genetic meddling, that allowed elements of the clan to gain their independence. Ironically, no sooner had the Goliaths gained their freedom from their creators than they enslaved themselves again through the creation of a savage hierarchy. From among their ranks, the strongest rose to dominate domes and hives, culminating in the ascendance of the Over-tyrant, the lord of all the Goliaths on Necromunda. This overlord holds dominion over the clan via the flow of life-giving stimms – chem cocktails essential to the continued existence of all Goliaths. The clan’s reverence of strength, however, grants the Over-tyrant this right, and while the members of House Goliath once rebelled against outside control, they willingly accept rulership by one of their own.*

*Goliaths are unique among the peoples of Necromunda, being on the whole gene-smithed beings, forged from a stable genus of humanity but enhanced for strength and endurance. Whether or not Goliaths are, in fact, abhumans remains a subject of much debate among the representatives of the Adeptus Terra on Necromunda, though the Imperium has deemed them ‘sanctioned’ for use on the hive world under the proviso that Lord Helmawr monitors their development. To date, most Goliaths are still largely created through esoteric biological means – rapidly grown in amneo-vats from flesh-templates and turned out into the refineries and factories for immediate hard labour. These brutish creations are mostly male and mostly sterile, living for less than a decade on a diet of backbreaking work and growth stimms before their bodies fail and they die. Despite this short life-span, Goliaths are born with a baseline knowledge of their world and their position in it, delivered via a cranial data-slug. During the years of slavery, this mnemonic injection was intended to keep the Goliaths ignorant and included only the basest information, keeping them at a learning level akin to a small child or a clever animal. After the Goliaths won their freedom, the Alphas ensured that the data-slug was altered to include the collected knowledge and experience of the Goliaths who had come before. In this way, the Goliaths share the knowledge of the clan gathered over hundreds of generations, giving them a working understanding of everything from hive industries to clan weaponry.*

*The members of House Goliath are notorious for their gen-hancing and bio- manipulation of their physical forms to monstrous levels. Many Goliath infants are vat-grown, the better to ensure a healthy specimen, whilst others are born of Goliath parents deemed suitable to reproduce for their adherence to the Goliath physical ideal. Whatever the infant’s origin, from an early age House Goliath utilises all manner of artificial assistance to boost its members’ abilities to superhuman levels, be it through the use of combat stimms or other, more esoteric drugs brokered through dealings with House Escher, or the genetic manipulation of their young, up to and including the surgical grafting on of huge volumes of extra muscle mass. There are almost no limits to which the members of House Goliath will not go in their pursuit of what they deem to be the physical ideal. Indeed, this manipulation of their form has gone on for so many centuries that there are those within the Administratum and the Adeptus Mechanicus who believe that many of House Goliath have evolved to become a distinct sub-set of abhuman unique to Necromunda. This is quite alarming considering that gen-hancement and vat-grown muscle grafting is common across the Imperium, and speaks volumes about the levels to which House Goliath has taken these practices.*

*Such abuse of growth stimms, surgeries and other methods is not without risks, however, as even the most baseline of Goliaths will show noticeable reductions in cognitive function. For Goliaths that push the limits of their physical form to the extreme, the risks are even greater. Rampant and uncontrollable muscle growth, spontaneous bone spur mutations, metabolisms that rage out of control and total loss of all higher brain functions are common. Such post-human flesh hulks are frequently seen in the gangs of the underhive, where in the crude parlance of the gangs they are called ‘Zerkers’, bringing rampant destruction to the foes of their house.*

### COUNTER-CHARGE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/#counter-charge)

Once per round, if all conditions are true:

- Active.
- An enemy charges the owner.

After the enemy movement, interrupt the Activation by performing a Charge (Double) action against the enemy fighter, including the Fight (Basic) action. Finally, the enemy can continue the Charge action and make the attacks as normal (if still Engaged).

*Hive legend has it that many thousands of years ago, during a different age of Necromunda, a now long-extinct type of reptile became the fashion accessory of choice for uphive nobility. Imported as eggs, once hatched these snappy little creatures were seen everywhere for a period of several seasons, kept in fine artificial habitats or carried around in specially-made hand luggage. They became almost common, rapidly…*

*But as they became common, so too did they become big, and with size came increased aggression. Many were culled after accidents led to lost digits, even lost limbs, and in some cases, so the legends go, loss of life. Many more were hurriedly discarded down waste chutes and heat sinks. And so, in the fullness of time, many were found by the denizens of the underhive. Over time, these strange creatures were captured as a new food source, but that practice ended as they were more likely to make food of their human hunters.*

*And there their story might have ended in extinction, but for the intervention of House Goliath. For some inexplicable reason, the Goliaths were attracted to these creatures as pets, taking pride in their size and strength, and revelling in their ferocity.*

*Today, the Sumpkrocs that House Goliath keep are somewhat different to the original creature, with centuries of genetic cloning causing a few changes and they no longer wholly resemble the creature first imported…*

# GOLIATH GENE-SMITHING

*Source: House of Chains*

*Goliaths are unique among the denizens of Necromunda, as they were grown for a purpose, rather than having evolved through chance; that purpose being to work the factories of the hive world. Engineered to be hardy and resilient, as well as strong and stoic, they excel in their task, though the legacy of their creation continues to shape them. Even when the Clan House broke away from its creators and earned its freedom, it took with it this heritage of genetic manipulation. The Goliaths’ gene-smithed past means there remains substantial genetic variance within each clan enclave and gang, each drawing their lineage from a different bio-lab, or Alpha. Some represent the best of their kind, toughest of the tough, and are blessed with the most valuable genetic gifts. While others carry biological missteps, their strength and toughness won at a price to their minds or their longevity. Then there are those that are barely true Goliaths at all, their bodies carrying the weakest of the clan’s genetics, even though their loyalty to the Over-tyrant remains undiminished.*

## USING GENE-SMITHING[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#using-gene-smithing)

Goliath Gene-smithing is a collection of rules allowing players to further customise their gangs by determining the genetic legacy of their fighters. They provide a huge amount of variety within a Goliath gang, and can be used to create small elite gangs of genetically superior Natborn, flesh-cursed gangs of Vatborn suffering from the biological tampering of their creators, or even gangs of aspiring Unborn who share few of the benefits of the Goliaths but who hope to prove themselves to the clan. Players can also run baseline Goliath gangs without spending any extra credits on Gene-smithing, simply by running gangs of Vatborn without any upgrades.

To use these rules, fighters must choose a sub-type (Natborn, Vatborn or Unborn) when they are added to the gang – Vatborn being the default sub-type. The cost of their sub-type is added to the fighter’s credits cost, as detailed in the House Goliath gang list. Other upgrades are optional, and can be added to fighters using the following guidelines:

- Fighters can only be Gene-smithed when they are added to the gang. Under unusual circumstances the Arbitrator might allow a fighter to be Genesmithed during campaign downtime.
- The fighter can only select Gene-smithing upgrades from those available to their sub-type (as detailed on the Vatborn, Natborn and Unborn tables as follows):
    - Fighters with the Gang fighter (Juve), (Prospect) or (Ganger) special rule can have a maximum of one Gene-smithed upgrade.
    - Fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (Leader) or (Champion) special rule may have a maximum of two Gene-smithed upgrades.

Customise the gang by determining the genetic legacy of the fighters. New fighters added to the gang can be given one of the following origins (affecting cost and gang rating).

## GOLIATH SUB-TYPES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#goliath-sub-types)

| Sub-type | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Vatborn | +0 credits |
| Natborn | +20 credits |
| Unborn | +10 credits |

INFO

## CHARACTERISTIC CHANGES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#characteristic-changes)

Some Gene-smithed upgrades either increase or decrease the characteristics of a fighter. After these changes have been made, the fighter’s new profile is considered to be their base profile for the purposes of Maximum Characteristics (see the Necromunda Rulebook). If a fighter has multiple Gene-smithed upgrades that alter their characteristics, then the effects are combined, either adding together or cancelling each other out.

## VATBORN FIGHTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#vatborn-fighters)

Vatborn fighters make up the vast majority of Goliath gangs, and have all the usual gifts and drawbacks of their kind. They are, however, the most mutable of their clan, and have available to them a wide variety of options for genetic tampering, many having been grown for particular environments or purposes. Vatborn fighters have the Baseline Goliath special rule:

### BASELINE GOLIATH[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#baseline-goliath)

*Even without the genetic manipulation common within the clans, a Goliath is an impressive specimen. Vatborn fighters represent the baseline of the Goliath genetic line, and have no specific benefits or drawbacks.*

When added to the gang, Vatborn fighters can choose from any of the Genesmithed upgrades opposite, adjusting the credits cost of the fighter accordingly. Note that some ‘upgrades’ have a negative cost. These represent flaws and deficiencies that weaken the fighter in some way. In these instances, the cost of the upgrade is deducted from the fighter’s base cost as shown in the Goliath gang list.

### VATBORN GENE-SMITHED UPGRADES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#vatborn-gene-smithed-upgrades)

| Upgrade | Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Reduced Bone DensityThis fighter’s bones lack the rock-like solidity of most Goliaths.Reduce either this fighter’s starting Strength characteristic or this fighter’s starting Toughness characteristic by 1. | -10 |
| Corrupted SlugA faulty data-slug has resulted in this fighter having only the basest level of education.Reduce this fighter’s Leadership, Willpower and Intelligence by 1. | -5 |
| Fearless But FoolishA quirk of the indoctrination process has resulted in this fighter having almost no regard for their own life.Increase this fighter’s Cool by 1, but reduce the fighter’s Intelligence by 1. | +5 |
| Genetic AncientThis Goliath comes from a long line of stable Vatborn, and carries within their body a kind of genetic memory, increasing their knowledge and sharpening their mind.Increase this fighter’s Leadership, Willpower and Intelligence by 1. | +10 |
| Hardened Immune SystemPoison finds little purchase within this fighter’s flesh, their organs and blood designed to swiftly purge harmful substances.Hits from weapons with the Gas or Toxin traits only ever affect this fighter on a roll of 6 when rolling against their Toughness. | +5 |
| Hyper HealingThis fighter’s flesh retains many of the regenerative properties of the amneo-tank.This fighter can roll an extra Injury dice when making a Recovery test and choose the dice they wish to use. In addition, during the post-battle sequence, if this fighter has any Lasting Injuries, roll a D6. On a 6, the fighter can heal one of their Lasting Injuries and remove its effects from their Fighter card. | +15 |
| Nerve BurnoutAge and the brutality of gang warfare have caused a nerve burnout in this fighter, making them more unstable.Reduce this fighter’s Cool by 1. | -5 |
| Dermal HardeningThe fighter’s skin is far thicker than normal, akin to a coating of ballistic cloth wrapped around their entire body.Increase this fighter’s Toughness by 1. | +10 |
| Terminal BiologyThe years are catching up with this fighter, and their body is beginning to fail them.Each time the fighter suffers a Lasting Injury (i.e., an effect that reduces one of their characteristics or results in them having to be taken to the Docs) roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the fighter perishes and is removed from the gang’s roster. | -10 |
| Overdeveloped MusculatureMassive slab-like muscles cocoon this fighter, and even their muscles have muscles! All this extra bulk does, however, mean they are slow, even by the standards of their kind.Increase this fighter’s Strength by 1 but reduce their Initiative by 1. | +5 |

## NATBORN FIGHTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#natborn-fighters)

Natborn are longer lived and more ‘evolved’ than their genetic cousins from the vat, though the promise of a longer life, and their superior intelligence, makes them less reckless with their existence. They enjoy some of the most potent genetic gifts of all Goliaths representing, as they do, a development of the clan’s genetic heritage from its inception as a slave race. Natborn fighters have the Clever but Cautious and Physical Perfection special rules:

### CLEVER BUT CAUTIOUS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#clever-but-cautious)

*The curse of heightened intelligence and a longer life means more incentive to hang on to both.*

Natborn alter their starting characteristics by increasing their Intelligence by 2, increasing their Willpower by 1 and decreasing their Cool by 1.

### PHYSICAL PERFECTION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#physical-perfection)

Natborn have the blessing of near-perfect flesh and can build their muscles faster than any of the other Goliath sub-types. Natborn Leaders, Champions, Prospects, Juves and Specialists can increase their Strength or Toughness at a cost of 6 XP rather than 8 XP. When Natborn Gangers gain an Advancement, they can either roll on the Ganger Advancement table (see the Necromunda Rulebook), or increase either their Strength or Toughness by 1.

When added to the gang, Natborn fighters can choose from any of the Genesmithed upgrades below, adjusting the credits cost of the fighter accordingly. Note that some ‘upgrades’ have a negative cost – this represent flaws and deficiencies that weaken the fighter in some way. In these instances, the cost of the upgrade is deducted from the fighter’s base cost as shown in the Goliath gang list.

### NATBORN GENE-SMITHED UPGRADES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#natborn-gene-smithed-upgrades)

| Upgrade | Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Adaptive BiologyThe gifts of a strong genetic legacy have given this fighter almost preternatural levels of strength and resilience, their body adapting swiftly to counter the worst Necromunda has to offer.This fighter may re-roll any Strength or Toughness checks they are required to take. Hits from weapons with the Gas or Toxin traits must re-roll the dice to see if they inflict an injury should they successfully equal or beat the fighter’s Toughness. | +10 |
| Adaptive MindGenetic memory combined with an evolving intelligence grants this fighter an instinctive understanding of countless fighting styles and skills.This fighter counts their Secondary skill sets as Primary skill sets when spending XP. | +5 |
| Alpha’s LineageThe blood of the Alpha flows in this fighter’s veins, making them a formidable addition to any underhive gang.This fighter counts the Leadership skill set as one of their Primary skill sets. In addition, if this fighter has the Group Activation (X) special rule, they may activate one more fighter than normal when using it. If the fighter does not have the Group Activation (X) special rule, they gain the Group Activation (1) special rule:Group Activation (1): When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly Goliath fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this fighter as part of a ‘Group Activation’:
• The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this way before any of them is activated.
• Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use this special rule during this activation. | +20 |
| Iron FleshGenerations of forge workers have passed onto this fighter an impressive resistance to pain, their skin hardened against both blades and burning gobbets of steel.Increase this fighter’s Wounds characteristic by 1. | +10 |
| Over-EngineeredThis fighter represents a mismatch of genetic heritages, some beneficial, some detrimental, making it more likely their body will betray them.When this fighter must roll on the Lasting Injury table, they must roll twice and accept the higher result. This Gene-smithed upgrade cannot be combined with Redundant Organs. | -10 |
| Prime SpecimenThis fighter is a perfect example of their kind, and represents the ideal that all Goliaths aspire to.This fighter can improve one of their characteristics by 1. | +10 |
| Rapid Muscle GrowthWith a minimum of effort, this fighter can build up their muscles until they are hulking beasts, massive even compared to the largest of their kind.This fighter can increase their Strength characteristic by up to 3 points, rather than the usual 2. | +5 |
| Redundant OrgansExtra organs have grown in this fighter’s body, providing them with redundancies in case of severe internal trauma.When this fighter must roll on the Lasting Injury table, they may roll twice and accept the lower result. This Gene-smithed upgrade cannot be combined with Over-engineered. | +15 |
| The Tyrant’s OwnThe Over-tyrant’s offspring are among the strongest of all Goliaths, and often walk the path of the Alpha, their gaze set upon one day claiming the title of Over-tyrant for themselves.This fighter can improve any two of their characteristics by 1. Only a Forge Tyrant (Leader) may take this Gene-smithed upgrade. | +20 |
| Tyrant’s PrideGoliaths grow in power only through competition with their kin, and the strongest among them soon defeat all challengers to their dominance, leaving them surrounded by lesser warriors.Only a Forge Tyrant (Leader) may take this Genesmithed upgrade. However, this fighter’s gang can include no fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (Champion) special rule. | -20 |

## UNBORN FIGHTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#unborn-fighters)

As outsiders, Unborn fighters bring a variety of benefits from other parts of Necromunda to House Goliath. They are also among the hardiest of the clan, often having survived great pain and peril to be counted as one of the Clan House. Unborn fighters have the ‘Outsider’ special rule:

### OUTSIDER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#outsider)

*A life before joining the Clan House has given the Unborn a wider experience of Necromunda and its societies than most Goliath ever see.*

Unborn fighters can choose to have an additional Primary skill set chosen from: Agility, Brawn, Combat, Cunning, Ferocity, Shooting or Savant. However, Unborn fighters may never select skills from the Muscle skill group.

When added to the gang, Unborn fighters can choose from any of the Genesmithed upgrades below, adjusting the credits cost of the fighter accordingly. Note that some ‘upgrades’ have a negative cost as they represent flaws and deficiencies that weaken the fighter in some way. In these instances, the cost of the upgrade is deducted from the fighter’s base cost as shown in the Goliath gang list

### UNBORN GENE-SMITHED UPGRADES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#unborn-gene-smithed-upgrades)

| Upgrade | Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Data-Slug OverlaySomething has gone wrong with the data-slug, its false engrams overlaying this fighter’s own memories, making them prone to flashbacks and bouts of madness.When this fighter activates for the first time in a battle, they must make an Intelligence check. If the check is failed, they become subject to the Insane condition (see the Necromunda Rulebook). | -10 |
| Doc’s ExperimentWhile this fighter was under the knife, the doc decided to try an experimental procedure.Select two of the following characteristics: Movement, Strength, Toughness or Wounds. Increase one characteristic by 1 and decrease the other characteristic by 1. You cannot choose a characteristic to decrease if doing so would lower it to 0. | +5 |
| Doc’s FailureWhile this fighter was under the knife, the doc may not have been focused enough on the task at hand...Select two of the following characteristics: Movement, Strength, Toughness or Wounds. Decrease both by 1. You cannot choose a characteristic to decrease if doing so would lower it to 0. | -10 |
| Genetic OutsiderAn air of distrust surrounds this fighter, no matter how hard they try to prove themselves, other Goliaths are unsettled by their presence.This fighter cannot use the Group Activation (X) special rule. Only a Forge Tyrant (Leader), or Forge Boss (Champion) may take this Gene-smithed upgrade. | -5 |
| MalformedMuscle grafts have given this fighter the size and appearance of a Goliath, but all the extra weight makes them ungainly and slow.This fighter increases their Strength characteristic by 1, but reduces their Initiative characteristic by 1. | +5 |
| Proto GoliathThis fighter has yet to undergo the transformative surgery to become accepted as a Goliath, though they aspire to be part of the clan.Increase the fighter’s Movement by 1, reduce their Strength by 1, reduce their Toughness by 1, reduce their Cool by 2, increase their Intelligence by 2, and increase their Willpower by 1. | -10 |
| Scar TissueGreat knots of scar tissue cover this fighter’s body, inuring them to both pain and damage.Reduce the Damage of all hits suffered by this fighter by 1, to a minimum of 1. | +10 |
| SurvivorThis fighter has suffered untold hardship during their life, yet each time death has tried to claim them, they have fought their way back from the abyss.When making Recovery tests for this fighter, they can re-roll one of the Injury dice rolled. | +10 |
| Stimm ImplantExperimental organs have been implanted in this fighter, feeding a steady stream of chems into their blood.When this fighter activates, they can choose to increase their Strength by 2 until the end of the round. However, if they do they must roll a D6 in the End phase. On a roll of 4+, they will suffer a Flesh Wound. | +5 |
| Two LivesDespite being remade into a Goliath, this fighter retains some of the skills from their previous life, memories that can sometimes be dredged to the surface.Whenever this fighter gains a skill as an advancement, or for free during gang creation, randomly generate a second skill from their Primary or Secondary skill sets. Make a note on this fighter’s Fighter card that these two skills are a pair. Whenever this fighter is selected to take part in a battle, one of these skills, determined at random, will be forgotten. To determine which skill is forgotten, assign one skill the numbers 1-3, and the other skill the numbers 4-6, then roll a D6. The number rolled indicates which of the pair of skills is forgotten. | +5 |

## THE IRONTREE REAVERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/gene-smithing#the-irontree-reavers)

DESIGNER’S COMMENTARY

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in Twins of Two Tunnels, as well as new options for Underhive Outcast and Goliath gangs. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used during a campaign.

The following additional Goliath Gene-smithing options are available when founding a Goliath gang:

| Upgrade | Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Thermal ResistanceVatborn Goliaths onlyThis fighter has been designed to work the heat of the forges for cycles at a time without breaks and as such their body has been adapted to withstand great heat without damage.Reduce the Strength of any attacks made with the Blaze trait against this fighter by 1, to a minimum of 1. | +10 |
| Enhanced StaminaNatborn Goliaths onlySome Goliaths come from long lines of cargo handlers, and a genetic legacy of hefting large, heavy and cumbersome loads around has left this fighter with the ability to carry far more than even their fellow Goliaths can manage.This fighter may treat weapons marked with a * as only taking up one of their weapon slots. | +20 |
| Unique Organ TransplantUnborn Goliaths onlyWhen this fighter was under the knife being transformed into a Goliath, something went wrong and they only survived due to the Doc using specially gene-coded organs that are expensive to maintain or replace.When this fighter suffers a Critical Injury, increase the credit cost of the Medical Escort action for them by D6x10 credits. | -10 |

# GOLIATH TERRAIN

*Source: House of Chains*

Gangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Goliath gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s Stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang takes part in unless noted otherwise.

## PLACING GANG TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#placing-gang-terrain)

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed, but after other terrain has been set up. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man's-land (i.e., anywhere outside both their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

### GOLIATH TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#goliath-terrain-1)

| Terrain | Cost | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Amneo Canisters | 60 credits | Rare (9) |
| Furnace Barricade | 10 credits | Common |
| Heavy Rivet Cannon | 75 credits | Rare (8) |
| Pillar of Chains | 20 credits | Common |
| Relic of the Forge | 100 credits | Rare (10) |

NOTE

## MODELLING GOLIATH TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#modelling-goliath-terrain)

Many of the gang-specific terrain detailed here can be represented by items from the Necromunda model range. For example, Amneo Canisters can be represented by Ammo Crates with appropriate gang markings, while Furnace Barricades can be represented by appropriately-marked Necromunda barricades. A Heavy Rivet Cannon could be created using a rivet cannon (such as a spare one from the Goliath gang sprue) fixed to a base. Others, such as the Pillar of Chains, can be represented by any appropriate marker, or a girder or pole on a base, hung with chains, while a Relic of the Forge could be anything from a marker to a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain, painted in the colours of the gang and hung with Goliath icons.

## AMNEO CANISTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#amneo-canisters)

*These contain the vital fluids of the growth vats, and can be used by Goliaths to rapidly heal wounds.*

A Goliath fighter within 3" of an Amneo Canister can remove a single Flesh Wound during the End phase of any round.

## FURNACE BARRICADE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#furnace-barricade)

*Heavy heat shields can be found throughout Goliath forges. Gangs often turn these thick plates into makeshift barricades where their folded ceramite layers prove especially effective against flamers and melta weaponry.*

A Goliath gang can place its Furnace Barricades anywhere in its deployment area or in no-man's-land. A fighter within 1" of a Furnace Barricade ignores both the Blaze or Melta traits when suffering hits, provided the barricade is granting them cover against the origin of the hit.

## HEAVY RIVET CANNON[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#heavy-rivet-cannon)

*Rivet guns and cannon are a vital tool of the Goliath factories, the heaviest examples are fixed to tripods or tracked carriages and supplied with an abundance of ammo. Unsurprisingly, gangs turn these tools into weapons, hauling them into position to cover corridors and doorways.*

Goliath gangs can only include Heavy Rivet Cannon if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. A Heavy Rivet Cannon uses the following profile:

| Weapon | Rg S | Rg L | Ac S | Ac L | S | AP | D | Am | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heavy Rivet Cannon |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - rapid fire | 6" | 18" | +1 | - | 4 | -1 | 2 | 3+ | Fixed, Rapid Fire (1), Rending |
| - super-heated | 3" | 12" | +2 | - | 6 | -2 | 2 | 3+ | Blaze, Fixed, Rending |

## PILLAR OF CHAINS (GANG RELIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#pillar-of-chains-gang-relic)

*Goliaths often use crude iron spikes hung with chains as a convenient method of securing slaves. Captives are dragged back to the Pillar of Chains, and locked in place for later transportation back to the Goliath enclave.*

When a gang with a Pillar of Chains has a chance to capture enemy fighters, it may re-roll one or both of the dice.

## RELIC OF THE FORGE (GANG RELIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-goliath/goliath-terrain#relic-of-the-forge-gang-relic)

*Forge relics are pieces of broken machinery that have been reshaped into a totem pole of clan icons and industrial weaponry. Gangs often use these to mark the boundaries of their territories, the grinning iron faces beaten into their sides a warning to trespassers.*

A Relic of the Forge counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, Goliath fighters within 3" of a Relic of the Forge ignore the effects of the Disarm trait and can re-roll failed Ammo checks. Enemy fighters who end their activation within 3" of a Relic of the Forge must make a Nerve test (see the Necromunda Rulebook) or become Broken.

Goliath gangs can only include a Relic of the Forge if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender.

# HOUSE ORLOCK

*They say the Orlocks have iron in their souls. But then you’d have to be made of the black ore of Necromunda to climb the spider’s web of Lord Helmawr’s feudal society as quickly as they have. In just three short millennia, House Orlock has risen from a loose alliance of Clan Families and waste prospectors to become the largest mining operation on the planet. It is a success built upon the backs of a massive slave underclass, the Drudges, born to scrape ore from the dark pits of the Spoil, or work endless cycles in the clan’s smoke- wreathed refineries. House Orlock has had a troubled history with this underclass, and at times they have threatened to rise up and tear down everything the Clan Families have fought to build. It speaks to the ruthlessness and determination of these families that they managed to endure these rebellions, ultimately building their entire social structure around the simmering discontentment within their ranks.*

*From the outside, however, the troubled history of the Drudges is largely unknown, or at the very least discounted, and it is not these unwashed masses that most consider when they think of the Orlocks. The image of the House of Iron is one of veteran rebels, outland ash-riders and bare-knuckled hardmen. This is entirely intentional, and the heads of the Orlock mining families have worked long and hard to cultivate a soldier class within the clan to fight for its interests, and keep the drudging classes in line. At the top of the Orlock social ladder, a small group of families hold power over millions of subjects, who, should they ever unite, could sweep this ruling class away in a single violent uprising. It is only the clan’s gangs that stand in the way of these would-be rebels. As paradoxical as it might seem, most of these gangs come from the drudging classes themselves, selected for their rebellious nature and fierce independence. Thus do the ruling families weed out troublemakers before they have a chance to incite rebellion, and turn them back upon their own kind, with a promise of freedom and power.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#gang-composition)

House Orlock follows the [normal rules](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.

## SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#special-rules)

Follow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:

- House Orlock has access to [Legendary Names](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#legendary-names), which are given to Leaders/Champions when created and can be purchased with XP as they advance.
- Specialist Gangers can use Heavy Weapons.

*Road Captains are without exception hard men and women, willing to thumb their nose at authority and forge their own path. However, Orlock gangers respect independence as much as strength, and a successful Road Captain needs to be the embodiment of both of these traits. Being a Road Captain means earning the respect of their gang through their own deeds. Unlike some gangs and clans of Necromunda, the brotherhoods and sisterhoods of House Orlock are a two-way street; if a leader in the House of Iron wants to have men and women follow them, then they had best be worthy of the right.*

**Skills:** 1 Primary (custom).

**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).

*A good Road Sergeant can take orders from their Captain, but has enough initiative to break the rules to get the job done. The very best Sergeants know just when to question their Captains and anticipate what they want before they even have a solid plan in mind. A Road Sergeant also needs to be able to step into the boots of the Road Captain should the latter go down or get killed, keeping the gang together and fighting.*

**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (1).

### RULE OF IRON[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#rule-of-iron)

- When activated, 1 visible Faction fighter within 6” gains the [Nerves of Steel](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#4-nerves-of-steel) skill (if not already having it).
- +2 modifier to any Bottle test while at least one friendly fighter with this ability is on the battlefield.

*If an Orlock gang gets large enough, it’s inevitable it’ll need an Arms Master to keep the Gunners and Greenhorns in line. Road Captains rely on their Arms Masters to enforce order within their gang, as well as leading by example – usually cracking heads or setting their cyber- mastiffs on those who cross the gang. To be an Arms Master means being hard as nails, even by the standards of House Orlock, and there are countless stories about these stony-faced fighters getting stabbed, blasted or shot and getting back up to make their enemies pay for making them mad.*

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Ganger), Promotion (Orlock Specialist), Tools of the Trade (Orlock Specialist).

*The bulk of Orlock gangs are made up of Gunners, hive-hardened men and women with a rebellious streak a mile wide. Most often they are drawn up from the drudging classes, where they never really fit in among work crews and mining towns, the gangs their last chance to prove their worth.*

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Orlock Road Sergeant or Arms Master), Hot-headed, Fast Learner.

### JUMP BOOSTER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#jump-booster)

Usable once per activation during a Move (Simple) or Charge (Double) action. It can be used in one of two ways:

- **Safe mode:** +3” M.
- **Overcharge:**
    - +1 S and +1 hit modifier when charging.
    - Must roll a D6:**1:** Pinned (malfunction, no move).**2:** +4" M.**3-4:** +5" M.**5-6:** +6" M.

When used, Grenade and Template weapons gain Unstable (for the rest of the activation).

Up to half of the move can be vertical (can move between levels and over impassable terrain if having sufficient movement). If the movement end in the air (insufficient movement to land safely on a level surface), fall the remaining distance (if the distance is 2” or less, it counts as jumping down).

*In every Clan House there are those fighters who court danger to an even greater extent than normal underhive gangers. Among the members of House Orlock these risk-takers are the Wreckers. In the tangled confines of the underhive, they jump among the gantries and tumbled domes taking out enemy fighters – while at the same time making sure they don’t take their head off on a low-hanging ceiling or end up as a stain on the floor from a bad landing.*

### WEAPONS PLATFORM[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#weapons-platform)

Firing an Unwieldy ranged weapon becomes a Basic action rather than a Double action.

### AMMO HOPPERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#ammo-hoppers)

Re-roll any failed ammo test results of 1 (before modifiers).

*Common across all of the worlds of the Imperium, servitors are melds of flesh andmachine, most often human flesh, but sometimes, as in the case of the Ambot, alien life forms slaved to a servitor engine. Most often, the human component of aservitor is harvested from a convicted criminal, one whose crimes are deemed toogreat to allow them to carry on as a part of Imperial society but who may continueto serve in another form rather than be wasted in incarceration or execution. Servitors possess the most rudimentary of human intelligence, their minds scrubbed of past memories and all but the most essential knowledge, artificial memory engrams grafted in their place so that they will know their designated roleand function and little else. Servitors are put to work in all manner of industry andfor any menial task with which an unmodified human cannot perform. They work inhostile environments, their living flesh variously blasted by extremes of heat and cold, eroded by extreme elements, or withered and wasted by toxic surroundings, performing their tasks until they fail, at which point their mechanics are reclaimedand a new human ‘donor’ grafted into place. House Orlock has ready access to mining and heavy industry servitors of all makes and manner, but those repurposedfor gang warfare often take the form referred to by the gangers as ‘Luggers’ – heavy, tracked units able to lift, move and carry bulky cargos. Be they liberated frommine workings or cargo depots, such constructs are well suited to a combat role with minimal reprogramming.*

### WATCHDOG[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#watchdog)

If the owner is a sentry, attackers can be spotted outside the vision arc. Add 1+ modifier to spotting (a 1 before modifiers still fails).

### LOYAL PROTECTOR[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/#loyal-protector)

While Standing (Active or Engaged) and within 3” of its owner, enemy fighters may not make a Coup de Grace against the owner.

*On Necromunda, dogs are no less common than anywhere else in the Imperium, though it must be said that they often provide a food source more readily than they provide their traditional roles of companion, guard or hunter. However, they do still have loyal friends amongst the people. Guilders breed and keep large hounds to protect their caravans and holdings, and House Orlock in particular takes great pride in the rearing of dogs as guards and fighters. The dogs of House Orlock show great diversity of type. From the sleek, alert watch dogs they raise to guard their mine workings and store houses, to the stocky, bull-like fighting dogs they breed for sport, Orlock Gangers are frequently accompanied by hounds. What’s more, to the outsider, there is a strange sentimentality shown by Orlocks towards their dogs, and it is not uncommon to see hounds sporting expensive cybernetics to compensate for past injuries or illness.*

# ORLOCK LEGENDARY NAMES

*Source: House of Iron*

An Orlock ganger lives and dies by their reputation, their fighters following them not just because they are the toughest underhiver around, but because everyone knows it. Road Captains, leaders and champions spend their lives amassing legends about themselves, some by doing great deeds – with plenty of witnesses – others by letting their followers talk them up in drinking holes and wasteland dives. Whether a legend is true or not, all that matters is that it takes on a life of its own. Soon people start referring to the Orlock by their nickname, which in turn is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they strive to live up to it no matter what.

Orlock Legendary Names are special names that can be given to an Orlock Leader or Champion, granting them additional benefits. For example, Orlock Gang Leader Rothgo Jax, could be given the Legendary Name ‘Iron Hard’, thus becoming Rothgo ‘Iron Hard’ Jax, and gaining the benefits of the Iron Hard name. Legendary names are not without their cost, however, as the flip side of being a legend is living up to your own hype. Each Legendary Name comes with a drawback, each of which is included as part of the Legendary Name’s special rules.

## USING LEGENDARY NAMES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#using-legendary-names)

Legendary Names are Advancements. They can be purchased for fighters using Experience points, and they can be given to characters when they are recruited:

- Any fighter can have up to two Legendary Names.
- Any fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule can have up to three Legendary Names.

Legendary Names may be taken by fighters as follows:

- Legendary Names can be gained as an Advancement. A fighter may be given a random Legendary Name (from one of the three categories available) for 3 XP, or may choose a Legendary Name for a cost of 6 XP. In both cases, this Advancement increases the fighter’s value by 5 credits. If a fighter gains a random Legendary Name that they cannot use, simply roll again.
- Any fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule may choose a Legendary Name when they are recruited, as well as choosing a skill (as described in their profile).

## UNBELIEVABLE ESCAPES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#unbelievable-escapes)

Some fighters are just impossible to kill. The ganger has a reputation for surviving things no ordinary person should – shrugging off rounds to the chest, stepping out of the way of incoming fire like they were dodging a punch, or snapping off knives driven into their gut, before knocking the attacker on their backside.

### 1. IRON HARD[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#1-iron-hard)

This fighter counts the first Serious Injury or Out of Action result they suffer during any battle as a Flesh Wound instead. However, if this fighter is taken Out of Action, their crew will automatically fail the next Bottle test it is required to make.

### 2. BULLET DODGER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#2-bullet-dodger)

Once per battle, when an enemy fighter makes a ranged attack that targets this fighter, you can force that enemy fighter to re-roll all successful to hit rolls made as part of that ranged attack. During this fighter’s next activation after this ability has been used, they can only make Move (Simple) actions.

### 3. BADZONE LEGEND[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#3-badzone-legend)

This fighter can make a special 3+ save roll against any damage sustained as a result of any environmental hazard (i.e., damage not originating from an attack by another fighter). During this fighter’s next activation after this ability has been used, they cannot initiate or take part in Group Activations.

### 4. PROMETHIUM-PROOF KILLER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#4-promethium-proof-killer)

This fighter ignores all of the effects of the Blaze trait. However, this fighter cannot benefit from or utilise the Leading by Example special rule.

### 5. SLIPPERY SCUMMER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#5-slippery-scummer)

If the fighter is ever captured (see the Necromunda Rulebook), they can choose to have another fighter from their gang be captured in their place. If this ability is used and another fighter is taken captive in this way, then the gang cannot and will not attempt a Rescue of that fighter.

### 6. BLADE BREAKER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#6-blade-breaker)

When this fighter is hit by an attack made by an enemy fighter using a weapon with either the Melee trait, the Versatile trait, or both, immediately roll a D6. On a roll of a natural 6, the hit automatically becomes a miss and the enemy fighter is immediately Disarmed (just as if they had been hit on a roll of 6 by a weapon with the Disarm trait).

## IMPRESSIVE LEADERSHIP[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#impressive-leadership)

In the underhive, it takes a big personality to lead a gang, and an even bigger one to be remembered after you’re on your way to the corpse-starch factorum. Impressive leaders intimidate those around them, use their guns to make unforgettable statements and get extra creds just for turning up.

### 1. BIGMAN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#1-bigman)

When this fighter makes a Group Activation, they may include fighters within 6" rather than the usual 3". However, this fighter must reduce the benefit of any cover they are in by 1 (i.e., while in Full Cover, enemy fighters only suffer a -1 modifier to their hit rolls when targeting this fighter, rather than the usual -2).

### 2. LUCKY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#2-lucky)

Once per battle, this fighter can change the result of any one dice they have rolled to a 6 (you may decide to use this ability after the dice have been rolled). However, in a battle that uses the Reinforcement rules, this fighter’s Fighter card must be placed in the Reinforcement deck.

### 3. IMPRESSIVE SCARS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#3-impressive-scars)

As long as a friendly fighter has a line of sight to this fighter, the distance between that fighter and this fighter does not matter for the purposes of the Leading by Example special rule. However, this fighter must reduce the number of fighters they can include in a Group Activation by 1.

### 4. TOO PRETTY FOR PRIMUS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#4-too-pretty-for-primus)

If this fighter is still on the battlefield at the end of a battle, their gang adds 2D6x5 credits to their Stash. However, if a double is rolled, these credits are added to your opponent’s Stash instead.

### 5. IRON STARE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#5-iron-stare)

Enemy fighters wishing to target this fighter with a ranged attack must first pass a Cool check if this fighter has a line of sight to that enemy fighter. In addition, this fighter never counts as the closest fighter for the purposes of Target Priority.

### 6. ROCK STEADY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#6-rock-steady)

As long as this fighter is Standing and Active, or Standing and Engaged, you can roll two D6 for Bottle tests and apply the lowest result. However, if your gang fails its Bottle test, friendly fighters must reroll a successful Cool check to see if they flee the battlefield.

## IMPROBABLE BEAT-DOWNS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#improbable-beat-downs)

Every Orlock has a tale of the time they knocked some underhive killer for six – some of them are even true! Leaders with legendary reputations about their combat prowess are said to be able to kill a foe with a single punch or land a bullet between their enemy’s eyes from the other side of a dome!

### 1. ONE PUNCH[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#1-one-punch)

When making an unarmed attack (see the Necromunda Rulebook) this fighter may choose to roll a single Attack dice, irrespective of their Attacks characteristic or any other bonuses. If this attack hits, it is resolved at Strength 8 and Damage 2, and no Save roll can be made (with the exception of Field armour).

### 2. BULLET LORD[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#2-bullet-lord)

Once per battle, rather than rolling the Firepower dice, this fighter can choose the result of the dice roll to be a 3. However, after working out the effects of the attack, the fighter’s weapon counts as having failed an Ammo check.

### 3. TWO-GUNS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#3-two-guns)

When this fighter uses the Twin Guns Blazing rule, after working out the effect of their attacks, enemy fighters within 6" must make a Nerve test. However, during any round in which this fighter uses the Twin Gun Blazing rule they cannot make, or participate in, a Group Activation.

### 4. CHANCER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#4-chancer)

Whenever this fighter hits an enemy fighter with an Improbable Shot, they gain D3 XP. When spending Experience on skill Advancements, this fighter cannot choose skills, and must always gain a randomly determined new skill instead.

### 5. HEADSHOT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#5-headshot)

If this fighter takes an enemy fighter Out of Action with their first Shoot (Basic) action of the battle, they gain D3 XP. However, all missed ranged attacks made by the fighter count as Stray Shots.

### 6. ONE SHOT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/legendary-names#6-one-shot)

Once per battle this fighter can choose to automatically hit with a ranged weapon attack, provided the weapon does not have the Rapid Fire (X) trait or the Blast (X) trait. However, if this fighter can take a Shoot (Basic) action during their activation they must do so. Note that, when this fighter uses this ability, they must still roll the Firepower dice.

# ORLOCK TERRAIN

*Source: House of Iron*

Gangs often make use of terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Orlock gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s Stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang plays unless noted otherwise.

## PLACING GANG TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#placing-gang-terrain)

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment zone, or, if noted, in no-man’s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

### ORLOCK TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#orlock-terrain-1)

| Terrain | Cost (Credits) | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sawn-off Surprise | 20 | Common |
| Promethium Barrels | 30 | Rare (8) |
| Servitor Sentry | 100 | Rare (11) |
| Tool Box | 50 | Rare (9) |
| Road Relic | 75 | Rare (10) |

## SAWN-OFF SURPRISE (BOOBY TRAP)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#sawn-off-surprise-booby-trap)

Sawn-off shotguns are a staple of House Orlock gangs, and find dozens of uses in their crews, including as part of traps to blast unsuspecting foes. A Sawn-off Surprise is a Booby Trap, and follows the rules for Booby Traps. It should be represented by a marker, or model on a 25mm base. When a Sawn-off Surprise explodes, all fighters within 3" take an automatic hit from a Sawn-off shotgun.

## PROMETHIUM BARRELS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#promethium-barrels)

Bullet-riddled barrels of waste promethium make for useful hazards when it comes to gang warfare. Orlock gangs will roll these barrels into an area before a fight, where their foul contents can leak out to saturate an area, ideally catching enemy fighters in the slick, hindering their movement and making them prone to burst into flames!

A Promethium Barrel can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain, or a model on a 25mm base. These pieces of terrain may be placed anywhere on the battlefield at least 3" from the enemy deployment zone. If a fighter, from either crew, activates within 3" of one of these markers, they can only make a single Move (Simple) action during their activation. In addition, if a fighter within 3" of a Promethium Barrel is hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait, add 1 to the dice when rolling to see if they are set on fire.

## SERVITOR SENTRY[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#servitor-sentry)

Servitors are used extensively throughout the hives of Necromunda, and House Orlock employs vast numbers of them for the autonomous piloting of transport rigs and cargo sorters. Some of these servitors find their way into Orlock gangs, most gangers favouring ‘Luggers’ for their size and ability to carry heavy weapons. Many of these are ripped right out of their old machines and lack arms or legs, being little more than a torso driven by mono-programming – more than enough to operate an autogun.

A Servitor Sentry can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain, or a model on a 25mm base. The servitor can only be deployed when the player’s gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender, and then it must be placed within their deployment zone. Servitors cannot move themselves, but can be moved by friendly fighters in the same way as a Loot casket. A Servitor Sentry has the following profile:

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 6+ | 5+ | 2 | 4 | 1 | 6+ | 1 | 12+ | 4+ | 6+ | 12+ |

### SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#special-rules)

**Living Wargear:** This model counts as a fighter in all regards, but cannot gain Experience, and counts all Lasting Injuries as Out Cold results. In addition, they automatically pass any Cool or Willpower checks they are required to take and automatically fail any Leadership or Intelligence checks they must make. They do not count for the purposes of Bottle tests, nor can they be included in a Reinforcement deck, and must always be deployed on the battlefield, in addition to the specified crew size.

### EQUIPMENT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#equipment)

A Servitor Sentry may be armed with either an autogun or a shotgun with solid and scatter ammo.

## TOOL BOX[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#tool-box)

All Orlock fighters carry tools on their belts, these ubiquitous kits a mark of being a member of the clan, as well as the difference between life and death out in the wastes. Sometimes a gang might bring along heavier equipment to help with the servicing of their weapons, vehicles or servitors. Carried around in old ammo containers, these tool boxes contain everything the gang might need for field repairs.

A Tool Box can be represented by a marker, an ammo crate or an appropriate model on a 25mm base. A Tool Box can be moved in the same manner as Loot caskets (see the Necromunda Rulebook). A friendly fighter within 1" of a Tool Box can take one Reload (Simple) action for free when they activate. In addition, a Cyber-mastiff, Ambot, Servitor Sentry or ‘Lugger’ Cargo Servitor that activates within 1" of a Tool Box can remove a single Flesh Wound or recover a single lost Wound on a D6 roll of 4+.

## ROAD RELIC (GANG RELIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-orlock/orlock-terrain#road-relic-gang-relic)

House Orlock gang relics are altars to the road gods of Necromunda. Fashioned from scavenged parts of destroyed ash-runners, crawlers or mighty war-rigs, they remind the gang of their mastery over the Ash Wastes and its trade routes. Often these relics will be hung with icons of the road, such as wheels, fuel tanks, or battered gun turrets – some of which still work.

A Road Relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook) and can be represented by a marker, an appropriate piece of terrain or a model on a 40mm base. In addition, a friendly fighter in base contact with a Road Relic can crew one of its turrets, using the following profile:

| Weapon | Rg S | Rg L | Ac S | Ac L | S | AP | D | Am | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turret heavy stubber |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - burst fire | 20" | 40" | - | - | 4 | -1 | 1 | 4+ | Rapid Fire (1), Fixed |
| - suppressive fire | 12" | 24" | +1 | - | 4 | -1 | 1 | 4+ | Rapid Fire (3), Fixed, Unstable |

        - Changed skill working on Van Saar Subtek

*Necromunda is a vast machine and the sons and daughters of House Van Saar are its engineers. While other clans and Noble Houses have been content to embrace the slavish traditions of the Imperium, in particular its superstitious fear of technology, those of House Van Saar have sought to unravel the mysteries of humanity’s lost age of advancement and progress. At times during their long history, their actions have brought them close to tech-heresy, and only the extreme secrecy of their Archeotek cabals and the benevolence of House Helmawr – which benefits most from their innovation – have protected them. This delving into the unknown, however, has taken its toll upon the Van Saar. It is not without good reason that the secrets of the Machine God are sacrosanct to the Adeptus Mechanicus. Those who seek to peek behind the curtain of creation must be ready to pay the price such knowledge brings – and so it was with House Van Saar.*

*At the heart of the Clan House is its secret STC, or Standard Template Construct system device. These rare and ancient tools are the most prized of relics to the Adeptus Mechanicus, whose agents and armies are endlessly scouring the galaxy in their quest for these venerated artefacts. Created using long-lost technologies, the STCs were given to colony ships during one of Mankind’s earlier expansions across the stars. Encoded into the imperishable hardware of each machine were the blueprints for all manner of things the colonists might need, from power sources and habitats to armoured vehicles and weapons. In an age during which so much knowledge has been lost to the slow entropy of time, each STC represents a priceless artefact, and in the case of the Van Saar STC, a near infinite source of wealth. It is around this wondrous machine that House Van Saar is built, and it is at once the blessing that affords its members continued existence, and the curse that condemns them to sickness and short lives.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/#gang-composition)

House Van Saar follows the [normal rules](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#gang-composition) for Gang Composition.

## SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/#special-rules)

**Wargear:** [Armoured bodyglove](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#armoured-bodyglove).

**Special Rules:** Gang Leader, Gang Hierarchy (Leader), Tools of the Trade, Group Activation (2).

- Special Rules
    
    **Gang Leader:** A House Van Saar gang must always include a single fighter with this special rule:
    
    - A fighter with this special rule may not retire during Campaign play. For a gang leader, the only way out is death.
    - Should this fighter die during the course of a campaign, or otherwise be removed from the gang (for example, if a captured Leader is Sold to the Guilders), another fighter must be promoted to replace them (see [Death of a Leader](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#death-of-a-leader)).
    
    **Gang Hierarchy (Leader):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Van Saar fighters that are within 12" of this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield. Additionally, during Campaign play this fighter may perform post-battle actions.
    
    **Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.
    
    **Group Activation (2):** When a fighter with this special rule is activated, their controlling player can choose to activate a number of additional Ready friendly Van Saar fighters equal to the number shown in brackets that are within 3" of this fighter as part of a ‘Group Activation’:
    
    - The controlling player must nominate all of the fighters who will be activated in this way before any of them is activated.
    - Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously. Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use this special rule during this activation. Skills: When recruited, a Van Saar Prime may choose one skill from their Primary skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not cost any XP and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.
- Skill Access
    
    A Van Saar Prime has access to the following skill sets:

    *Primes are the masters of the Van Saar clan gangs. In the war for supremacy among the Clan Houses, they are the captains and commanders of the foot soldiers, leading their troops into battle against the unenlightened, the barbarian or those who would see the STC harmed in any way. Each one is a master of technology, especially that created by the clan Archeoteks, and brings a truly terrifying array of weapons with them when they enter battle in the name of their masters.*

    - Once all participants of the Group Activation have been nominated, the controlling player selects one and activates them as normal, fully resolving their activation before selecting and activating the next. Each fighter activates individually; groups do not activate simultaneously.
    
    Additional fighters with this special rule activated in this way may not themselves use this special rule during this activation.
    
    **Skills:** When recruited, a Van Saar Augmek may choose one skill from their Primary skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not cost any XP and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.

    *Second to the Primes are the Augmeks. Only slightly less dangerous in battle, they are well versed in countless forms of technological warfare and advanced wargear forms. Often they will act as the gang’s ‘heavies’, lugging massive weapons into battle, giving their Prime access to unrivalled firepower. Augmeks also stand ready to take up the leadership role should their Prime fall, allowing the Van Saar gang to transition swiftly from one commander to another without any loss of combat effectiveness.*

**Special Rules:** Gang Hierarchy (Champion), Tools of the Trade, Master of Cyberteknika.

- Special Rules
    
    **Gang Hierarchy (Champion):** During a battle, once this fighter’s gang has failed a Bottle test, during any End phase in which this fighter passes its Cool check and does not flee the battlefield, any friendly Van Saar fighters that are within 6" of this fighter will automatically pass their Cool check and will not flee the battlefield. Additionally, during Campaign play this fighter may perform post-battle actions.
    
    **Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.
    
    **Master of Cyberteknika:** The cost of any Cyberteknika purchased for a Van Saar Archeotek is reduced by half, before rounding up to the nearest 5 credits.
    
    In addition, a Van Saar Archeotek may choose any one Alpha level item of Cyberteknika to be equipped with when they are added to the gang. This does not cost any credits and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.
    
    **Skills:** When recruited, a Van Saar Archeotek may choose one skill from their Primary skill sets (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook). This skill does not cost any XP and does not increase the fighter’s credits value.

### VAR SAAR NEOTEK (PROSPECT)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/#var-saar-neotek-prospect)

| 5" | 5+ | 4+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4+ | 1 | 9+ | 8+ | 9+ | 7+ |

**Wargear:** [Armoured bodyglove](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#armoured-bodyglove) and [Grav-cutter](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#grav-cutter).

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Prospect), Tools of the Trade, Promotion (Van Saar Augmek or Van Saar Archeotek), Hot-headed, Fast Learner.

- Special Rules
    
    **Tools of the Trade:** This fighter enjoys access to a wide variety of weapons. A fighter with this special rule may take multiple equipment sets.
    
    **Gang Fighter (Prospect):** Fighters with this special rule form the backbone of House Van Saar gangs. The total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or Hired Guns.
    
    **Promotion (Van Saar Augmek or Van Saar Archeotek):** If, during the Downtime phase of a campaign, this fighter has gained five or more Advancements, this fighter may be promoted to become either a Van Saar Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek as the controlling player wishes.
    
    When a fighter is promoted in this way, they will from now on count as a Van Saar Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek for the purposes of determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. Their existing characteristics do not change, but they will lose the Promotion (Van Saar Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek), Hot-headed and Fast Learner special rules and gain all the special rules associated with a Van Saar Augmek or a Van Saar Archeotek, as appropriate.
    
    Note that when a fighter is promoted in this way (especially when promoted to become an Archeotek), an appropriate model should be used to represent their new category and type.
    
    **Hot-headed:** Fighters with this special rule have much to prove and often act on impulse alone, hoping to impress their superiors. Consequently, older and wiser fighters expect them to be short-lived. Should a fighter with this special rule be Seriously Injured or be taken Out of Action, friendly fighters that are within 3" do not have to take a Nerve test, unless they also have this special rule.
    
    **Fast Learner:** During Campaign play, when this fighter gains a characteristic Advancement, they do not need to spend an additional 2 XP if the characteristic being improved has already been improved. In other words, this fighter may improve a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum) for the basic XP cost shown each time.
    
- Skill Access
    
    A Van Saar Neotek has access to the following skill sets:

    *Reckless and young, Neoteks have yet to feel the full effects of the wasting inflicted on the Van Saar by their use of their STC’s technologies. They favour either untested or dangerous tech, and are perhaps most well-known for their use of grav-cutters. Racing through the hive’s close confines on a repulsor platform like a cutter might look cool but, as more than one Neotek has discovered, it can be fatal.*

    *The foot soldiers of the Van Saar clan gangs are the Teks. Despite their humble status in a Clan House filled with technological geniuses and augmented cyber- warriors, a Tek is often better equipped and trained than their rivals from other gangs. The armour built into their survival suit, combined with access to highgrade energy weapons, is only part of this – the remainder being increased intelligence and an education second only to those born in the spire.*

**Wargear:** [Armoured bodyglove](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#armoured-bodyglove).

**Special Rules:** Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Van Saar Specialist), Fast Learner.

- Special Rules
    
    **Gang Fighter (Juve):** Fighters with this special rule form the backbone of House Van Saar gangs. The total number of fighters with the Gang Fighter (X) special rule in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of fighters without the Gang Fighter (X) special rule combined, not counting Hangers-on or Hired Guns.
    
    **Promotion (Van Saar Specialist):** If, during the Downtime phase of a campaign, this fighter has gained five or more Advancements, this fighter may be promoted to become a Van Saar Specialist.
    
    When a fighter is promoted in this way, they will from now on count as a Van Saar Specialist for the purposes of determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. Their existing characteristics do not change, but they will lose the Gang Fighter (Juve), Promotion (Van Saar Specialist), and Fast Learner special rules and gain all the special rules associated with a Van Saar Specialist.
    
    **Fast Learner:** During Campaign play, when this fighter gains a characteristic Advancement, they do not need to spend an additional 2 XP if the characteristic being improved has already been improved. In other words, this fighter may improve a characteristic any number of times (up to the maximum) for the basic XP cost shown each time.

    *Green Teks are sometimes referred to within the clan as Subteks – though these fighters are very capable, they are yet to be truly tested in battle. While other gangs often treat such lowly members of their crew as cannon fodder, hurling them into a fight with little thought to their survival, the existence of a Subtek is different. This comes down to the value the Van Saar place on all their fighters, and a desire to see them rise in the ranks rather have their lives thrown away.*

    *Servo-rigs are effectively mechanical exoskeletons, most commonly seen in heavy industry, where workers may be equipped with them to aid with lifting and moving heavy materials or operating large tools or machinery – anywhere where weights not normally manageable by baseline humans must be handled, but where duties cannot readily be entrusted to abhumans or servitors. Where most servo-rigs are worn over the body and limbs, controlled by the wearer’s physical movements and granting themextra strength, servo-rigs are often also utilised to give a worker extra limbs, greatly increasing their dexterity and the range of tasks that can be performed, making what may otherwise be the work of many, the work of a few. Such a rig may be plugged directly into the wearer’s nervous system and controlled directly, or may be automated, forcing a worker to keep up with the pre-programmed movements of the rig into which they are strapped.*
    
    *Van Saar makes particular use of such things, in no small part due to the physical deficiencies common within their House. Highly-advanced forms of servo harness, controlled by the wearer’s nervous system or via a direct MIU are common, advanced artisan pieces that put to shame the simple utilitarian forms mass produced and seen in wide use. In battle, it is not uncommon to see Van Saar fighters wearing massive rigs that grant them a huge, spider-like appearance, with many mechanical limbs that greatly increase the combat efficiency of the gang as a whole.*

    *The Arachnika Ash-jumper is a wasteland variant of the Van Saar Arachni-rig. More heavily armoured and equipped with an array of heavy weapons, Van Saar wasteland gangs and expeditions often use it in place of rigs and runners, especially when operating in dangerous or difficult environments. The Arachnika has proven its worth time and again against enemy vehicles and nomad war parties, the former often caught off-guard by its speed and the latter often unable to smash through its thick plating. Its heavy weaponry is more than the equal of enemy armour – lascannon blasting through the sides of Cargo-8s, plasma guns vaporising enemy fighters and flamers incinerating anything that strays too close. Even its harpoon launcher allows it to drag foes closer or plunder cargo with a well-placed shot, while its ability to take to the air on a plume of ash and flame as its jump boosters kick in, allows it to both leap free of trouble or drop into the midst of its foes unexpectedly. A favoured tactic of Arachnika pilots is to jump from cover up into the low choking cloud cover of the ash wastes, before descending without warning to either carve apart a vehicle with their guns or crush unwary fighters under its metal bulk, before leaping away again into the clouds.*

    **Clamber:** When this fighter climbs, the vertical distance they move is not halved. In other words, they always count as climbing up or down a ladder.
    
    **Fear Inducing:** Cyberachnids have the Fearsome (Ferocity) skill and may confer this onto their owner. The owner only gains this skill provided they have an Active Cyberachnid within 3", otherwise the skill is lost.
    
    **Fearsome (Ferocity):** If an enemy makes a Charge action that targets this fighter, they must make a Willpower check before moving. If the check is failed, they cannot move and their activation ends immediately.
    
    **Horrific:** A Cyberachnid is a horrifying meld of machine and spider that gangers of other Houses would just as soon not have in their hide-out. A Cyberachnid can never be Captured.

    *Spiders are common to every human-colonised world in the galaxy. Perhaps millennia ago, when Mankind set out to populate the stars, those first ships had onboard stowaways in the form of insects and arachnids, and they were accidentally introduced to new ecosystems. Perhaps they were deliberately introduced to control dangerous insect life on many worlds. Or perhaps they were always there. No one knows for sure, but that spiders can be found almost everywhere humanity thrives is beyond doubt.*
    
    *The hives of Necromunda are infamous for their mutant spiders, and many millions of subspecies exist in the dark corners and dusty cracks of the great hives. Some varieties can grow to several feet across, and their presence can make whole domes uninhabitable.*
    
    *The spiders of Necromunda mean much to the planet, not least featuring heavily in the heraldry of many clans and ruling families. Yet possibly the most readily-made association is to the House of Van Saar, whose sigil is the likeness of a spider. Van Saar play on this, capturing and breeding large Necromundan arachnids and modifying them cybernetically for many purposes. Van Saar gangs are often accompanied by several such slaved servitor spiders, and their gruesome appearance is often enough to make the faint-hearted maintain what they feel is a safe distance, but in truth is right in the crosshairs, where the Van Saar want them…*

# VAN SAAR ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA

*Source: House of Artifice*

House Van Saar has a well-deserved reputation for tech, and bionics in particular, their artisans providing augmetics for many of the Great Houses, as well the Merchant Guild, powerful criminals, and anyone else who can pay their high prices. This mastery of the cybernetic comes not solely from a desire to bring wealth to the Clan House, but out of a necessity to preserve the failing flesh of its people. By the time a Van Saar clanner comes of age, their body will already be starting to fail them, kept alive only by the systems of their survival suits. As they age, or are wounded in the endless wars of the underhive, their body will degrade further, and only the intervention of augmetics can keep them going. Fortunately for a Van Saar ganger, access to the clan’s Cyberteknika (as it is known within the Clan House) is plentiful, and a successful fighter can greatly extend their own life span, enhance their abilities and hide their inward degeneration through the use of masterfully wrought artificial skin and limbs.

## USING ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#using-archaeo-cyberteknika)

All Van Saar fighters have access to Cyberteknika, and as they gain advances or suffer injuries they can use Cyberteknika to repair and enhance themselves. There are a few ways for a fighter to gain a piece of Cyberteknika – either to repair a Lasting Injury, once they have spent Experience points for an advancement (representing the fighter’s body aging) or during gang creation (reflecting the older, more experienced, members of the gang).

To repair a Lasting Injury, during any post-battle sequence, the player simply pays the credits cost for the Cyberteknika associated with the injury (Eyes, Hands, etc) and places the fighter Into Recovery. Once the fighter leaves Recovery, the effects of the Injury will have been replaced with the effects of the Cyberteknika.

Alternatively, when a fighter gains a new advance, they may also replace any of their body parts with a piece of the Cyberteknika, paying the credits cost and going Into Recovery as above.

Finally, Van Saar fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule may be given Cyberteknika during gang creation at the cost listed as follows.

## UPGRADING ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#upgrading-archaeo-cyberteknika)

Once a fighter has a piece of Cyberteknika, it is permanent. Cyberteknika can be used to replace any Bionics (as found in the Trading Post) in the location it is taken (Eyes, Hands, etc), and a fighter can only have one type of Cyberteknika in each location on their body. All Cyberteknika comes in three levels, ranked Alpha (the most basic), Gamma (intermediate), and Omega (the most advanced). When a fighter gains a piece of Cyberteknika, they can choose any level provided they can pay its cost in credits.

Fighters can also upgrade their Cyberteknika – this is the only instance in which they can change the type of Cyberteknika they have. To upgrade a piece of Cyberteknika the fighter must pay the difference between the cost of the level they have and the next level up, after which they will go into Recovery. Once the fighter leaves Recovery, they gain the improved piece of Cyberteknika (i.e., Alpha becomes Gamma and Gamma becomes Omega). Omega Cyberteknika cannot be upgraded.

## DAMAGED ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#damaged-archaeo-cyberteknika)

If a fighter with Cyberteknika suffers a Lasting Injury to a location with Cyberteknika, roll a D6. On a 4+ the Lasting Injury itself is ignored, though the fighter must still go into Recovery. Otherwise the Cyberteknika is damaged and stops working (the fighter can no longer use its benefits), and the fighter then goes into Recovery. Note, however, that none of the other effects of the Lasting Injury are applied against the fighter.

To repair a piece of Cyberteknika the fighter must pay half its cost in credits during the pre-battle sequence of any battle, or during downtime in a Campaign.

## CRANIAL CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#cranial-cyberteknika)

Cranial Cyberteknika represents any number of cognitive cybernetics or brain implants that repair cortical damage or enhance mnemonic function:

| Omega | 105 credits | This fighter is considered to always be equipped with an infra-sight and a mono-sight, the benefits of which are applied to any ranged weapon they carry, and photo-goggles. |

## SINDEXTROUS CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#sindextrous-cyberteknika)

Sindextrous Cyberteknika repair hands and arms with corded bionics, making limbs more responsive and intricate manipulation far easier for the fighter, giving them a level of dexterity beyond that of their mortal flesh.

| Gamma | 75 credits | This fighter ignores the effects of the Disarm trait and they do not suffer a -1 to hit modifier when making close combat attacks if they have to turn to face their opponent before attacking. |
| Omega | 125 credits | This fighter ignores the effects of the Disarm trait and they do not suffer a -1 to hit modifier when making close combat attacks if they have to turn to face their opponent before attacking. In addition, this fighter’s attacks cannot be parried. |

## MOTIVE CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#motive-cyberteknika)

Motive Cyberteknika are leg, back and foot augmetics that add to the speed and agility of the fighter, allowing their limbs to instinctively cope with the difficult terrain of the underhive in a way fragile human appendages cannot.

- This Cyberteknika upgrade repairs the damage caused when a fighter suffers a Hobbled Injury result on the Lasting Injury table.
- This Cyberteknika upgrade may be damaged if the fighter suffers a future Hobbled Injury result on the Lasting Injury table.
- Each level of this Cyberteknika grants the fighter the benefits detailed below:

| Level | Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha | 35 credits | This fighter ignores any negative Movement modifiers caused by moving through difficult terrain. |
| Gamma | 65 credits | This fighter ignores any negative Movement modifiers caused by moving through difficult terrain and adds 2" to their Movement when moving vertically (for example, when climbing up a ladder or other vertical surface). |
| Omega | 100 credits | This fighter ignores any negative Movement modifiers caused by moving through difficult terrain and adds 2" to their Movement when moving vertically (for example, when climbing up a ladder or other vertical surface). In addition, this fighter may re-roll failed Initiative checks to see if they fall when they go from Standing to Prone within ½" of the edge of a level or platform. |

## TORSONIC CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#torsonic-cyberteknika)

Torsonic Cyberteknika bone bracing and spinal grips make the fighter far more sturdy, granting them not just increased strength of body but also the ability to wield weapons with an ease they never could before:

- This Cyberteknika upgrade repairs the damage caused when a fighter suffers a Spinal Injury result on the Lasting Injury table.
- This Cyberteknika upgrade may be damaged if the fighter suffers a future Spinal Injury result on the Lasting Injury table.
- Each level of this Cyberteknika grants the fighter the benefits detailed below:

| Level | Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha | 50 credits | An unarmed attack made by this fighter has a Damage characteristic of 3, rather than the usual 1. |
| Gamma | 75 credits | An unarmed attack made by this fighter has a Damage characteristic of 3, rather than the usual 1. In addition, this fighter may apply a +2 modifier to their Strength characteristic when resolving hits made with a weapon that has either the Melee or Versatile trait. |
| Omega | 150 credits | An unarmed attack made by this fighter has a Damage characteristic of 3, rather than the usual 1. In addition, this fighter may apply a +2 modifier to their Strength characteristic when resolving hits made with a weapon that has either the Melee or Versatile trait. Finally, any weapon this fighter is equipped with is considered to have suspensors fitted to it. |

## VASCULAR CYBERTEKNIKA[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/archaeo-cyberteknika#vascular-cyberteknika)

Vascular Cyberteknika replaces key organs within the fighter’s body, usually their heart and lungs, granting them resistance to the perils of the underhive, but also a level of regenerative ability.

- This Cyberteknika upgrade repairs the damage caused when a fighter suffers an Enfeebled Injury result on the Lasting Injury table.
- This Cyberteknika upgrade may be damaged if the fighter suffers a future Enfeebled Injury result on the Lasting Injury table.
- Each level of this Cyberteknika grants the fighter the benefits detailed below:

| Level | Cost | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alpha | 40 credits | This fighter may apply a +1 modifier to their Toughness characteristic for the purposes of the number of Flesh Wounds they can take before going Out of Action. |
| Gamma | 80 credits | This fighter may apply a +1 modifier to their Toughness characteristic for the purposes of the number of Flesh Wounds they can take before going Out of Action. In addition, this fighter may re-roll any Toughness check they are required to make. |
| Omega | 130 credits | This fighter may apply a +1 modifier to their Toughness characteristic for the purposes of the number of Flesh Wounds they can take before going Out of Action. In addition, this fighter may re-roll any Toughness check they are required to make. Finally, in the End phase of each round, this Fighter may discard a Flesh Wound they have suffered. |

MODELLING ARCHAEO-CYBERTEKNIKA

The bionics used by the Van Saar, while functionally very similar to those employed by the majority of Necromundans, are of exceptional quality. Quite often they will be indistinguishable from human limbs, especially if concealed under their survival suits, and to the untrained eye a Van Saar fighter might appear completely natural – even if they are anything but. With this in mind, players should feel free to add Cyberteknika to their Necromunda models without the need to convert them – it can be imagined that the fighter’s enhancements are hidden under their suit or appear identical to the real thing. That said, if a player wants to represent bionic limbs, eyes and other augments (perhaps raiding other kits from the Citadel Miniatures range for parts) then they should be able to do so, for not all Van Saar fighters favour subtlety, and many wear their bionics out in the open for all to see.

# VAN SAAR TERRAIN

*Source: House of Artifice*

Gangs often make use of cunning terrain in their battles against their rivals. Sometimes this is whatever is lying around the underhive battlefield, such as barrels for cover or boltholes from which to launch ambushes. Other times they bring the terrain with them, setting up fixed weapon platforms, defensive barricades or piles of ammo crates within easy reach of their fighters.

Van Saar gangs can call upon a number of specialist terrain features to include in their gang. These pieces of terrain are bought from the Trading Post during the post-battle sequence. Once bought, they are added to the gang’s stash, and can be fielded in any battle the gang takes part in unless noted otherwise.

## PLACING GANG TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#placing-gang-terrain)

Gang terrain is placed on the battlefield before any fighters are deployed. A gang can place its terrain in its own deployment area, or, if noted, in no-man’s-land (i.e., anywhere outside their opponent’s deployment zone and their own deployment zone). Some pieces of terrain (as noted in their descriptions) can only be used if the gang is the defender in a scenario with an attacker and a defender.

### VAN SAAR TERRAIN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#van-saar-terrain-1)

| Terrain | Cost | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rad Cannon Emplacement | 145 credits | Rare (8) |
| Thermal Mine | 70 credits | Rare (11) |
| Energy Sink | 60 credits | Rare (10) |
| Rad Casters | 40 credits | Rare (10) |
| Archaeo-relic | 80 credits | Rare (9) |

## HIDDEN TRAPS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#hidden-traps)

Some traps are cunningly hidden among the gloom and debris of the underhive, fighters not knowing if a pile of rubble is just more rubbish or a deadly surprise. If a trap uses the Hidden Traps rule then it is represented on the battlefield by not one but six markers. These markers can be tokens, or appropriate terrain elements on 25mm bases. When preparing these markers, one out of the six is the real trap (mark its underside, or secretly make a note to determine which one is real), the others are false traps. When a fighter triggers a trap, as detailed in the trap’s description, it is revealed. False traps are discarded while the real trap remains on the battlefield. Note that even when the real trap is revealed, other false traps remain on the battlefield until they have been interacted with – this is important if more than one trap is in play, as it will keep the enemy guessing as to just how many traps remain to be discovered.

## RAD CANNON EMPLACEMENT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#rad-cannon-emplacement)

*The signature weapons of House Van Saar are those which utilise the same deadly radiation that blights the very existence of the Van Saar themselves against their enemies. To the Van Saar, such weapons hold little terror – they are accustomed to wearing protective gear that shields them against this invisible poison, and spend their lives enduring the painful treatments required to purge their thin blood of radiation – but to outsiders, the debilitating after-effects of Rad weapons are fearful to behold.*

Van Saar gangs can only include a Rad Cannon Emplacement if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. A Rad Cannon Emplacement uses the following profile:

| Weapon | Rg S | Rg L | Acc S | Acc L | Str | Ap | D | Ammo | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rad Cannon | 24" | 48" | - | -1 | 2 | -2 | 1 | 3+ | Blast (5"), Fixed, Rad-phage, Unwieldy |

## THERMAL MINE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#thermal-mine)

*A Thermal Mine is a larger, more powerful version of a melta bomb. When set off, the area within several metres of the mine is rapidly heated to temperatures high enough to melt rock. The effect on living organisms is profound, to say the least!*

Thermal Mines are traps, and use the Hidden Traps rules. Thermal mines can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.

When an enemy fighter moves within 2" of a Thermal Mine marker, they must immediately stop and make an Initiative check. If this check is passed, they can continue their movement as normal. If it is failed, flip over the marker to see if it is the real trap as per the Hidden Traps rule. If it is a false trap, discard the marker. If it is the real trap, it explodes immediately with the following profile. Note that when a Thermal Mine explodes, every fighter that is currently within 6" of the marker is hit, whilst those that are within 3" of the marker are not only hit, but suffer the effects of the Melta trait.

| Weapon | Rg S | Rg L | Acc S | Acc L | Str | Ap | D | Ammo | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Melta trap | 3" | 6" | - | - | 8 | -4 | 3 | - | Blaze, Melta |

## ENERGY SINK[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#energy-sink)

*An Energy Sink works by drawing power from its immediate environment to charge power cells. Prohibited across most of the Imperium due to how easily they can be misused to collect ‘free’ energy, House Van Saar seemingly cares little, utilising Energy Sinks to power their own weapons and disarm their enemies.*

An Energy Sink can be represented by either a marker or a piece of terrain on a 25mm base. An Energy Sink can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.

Any fighter, friend or foe, that attempts to make a ranged attack with a las or plasma weapon, or a weapon with the Melta trait, or that attempts to make a close combat attack with a weapon with the Power trait whilst too close to an Energy Sink will find its Strength reduced:

- If the fighter is within 3" of the Energy Sink, reduce the weapon’s Strength by D3, to a minimum of 1.
- If the fighter is within 6" of the Energy Sink, reduce the weapon’s Strength by 1.

## RAD CASTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#rad-casters)

*Rad Casters hung from low ceilings or doorways slowly release deadly radiation into the air. They can be represented by either a marker or a piece of terrain on a 25mm base, and can be set up anywhere on the battlefield outside of your opponent’s deployment area.*

In the End phase, a fighter within 3" of a Rad Casters must make a Toughness check, adding +1 to the roll for each item of Wargear and armour that protects against weapons with the Rad-phage trait. If this check is failed, or the roll was a natural 6, the fighter suffers an immediate Flesh Wound.

Rad Casters can be thrown by a friendly fighter in base contact with them, just as if they were a grenade. Work out this attack as normal, counting the Rad Casters as a rad grenade. Once the attack has been worked out, remove the marker from the battlefield.

## ARCHAEO-RELIC[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/house-van-saar/van-saar-terrain#archaeo-relic)

*House Van Saar relics are shrines to the wonders of technology. Strange structures that combine together advanced cogitation devices, weird power sources, and bizarre sensor arrays. Such devices are so alien in design to outsiders that they could easily be mistaken for being xenos in origin, and their disturbing appearance, combined with the strange waves of static and pulses of white noise, can deeply affect even the most unflappable of underhivers.*

An Archaeo-relic counts as a Gang Relic (see the Necromunda Rulebook). In addition, enemy fighters who end their activation within 3" of an Archaeo-relic must make an Intelligence check. If the check is passed, nothing happens. If, however, the check is failed, the fighter immediately becomes subject to the Insane condition (as described in the Necromunda Rulebook).

Van Saar gangs can only include an Archaeo-relic if they are the defender in a scenario with an attacker and defender. An Archaeo-relic can be represented by an appropriate marker or a suitably impressive piece of industrial terrain, painted in the colours of the gang and modelled to represent advanced technology utilising unnatural and dangerous energy sources.

Note that if the Archaeo-relic is defiled (see the Necromunda Rulebook), it loses the bonuses it provides to Cool and Leadership checks, but retains its other benefits.

# VENATORS (BOUNTY HUNTERS)

*The underhive is infested with criminals, killers, deviants and worse – making it a rich hunting ground for the so-called Venator bands – temporary coalitions of normally solitary Bounty Hunters.*

*All across Necromunda, from the drudging halls of manufactorums and precinct blockhouse walls, to the rusting gates of downhive settlements and cross-tunnel gibbets, images of the faces of wanted individuals flutter in the stale breeze of the carbon scrubbers. A group of talented murderers can make a healthy living collecting the bounties of these criminals, killers and deviants.*

*The motley bands of hired guns who go after these bounties are commonly known as Venators, after the ancient High Gothic name for a hunting party; a temporary coalition of Bounty Hunters out for blood and coin. With the promise of shared rewards and extra firepower, Venators form into gangs and pursue Merchants Guild patronage and the stability that comes from regular contracts. Drawn from every Clan or House on Necromunda, Venators come in all shapes and sizes – mixing ex-Goliath heavies and nimble Escher assassins, alongside disgraced watchmen or embittered outcast nobles. Most of them are sanctioned by the Guilders or the Imperial House itself, and carry a hunter’s oath-token as proof of their patronage. However, many are not, though the Guilders often pay for the gang’s captives and kills all the same. In the underhive, lawmen don’t ask too many questions if a masked killer dumps the corpse of a wanted ganger at their feet – they hand over the scrip and sleep a little sounder with one less criminal at large.*

# PALANITE ENFORCERS

*Necromunda endures by the grace of the God-Emperor and His inexhaustible armies, but beneath the world’s toxic storm clouds it falls to the agents of the Imperial House to maintain the peace and enforce the law. When one must govern a populace of billions, all crammed into the close confines of ancient cities and eking out their lives on recycled food while they toil endlessly at their tasks, kind words and even-handed rules are not enough. Only a boot stamping down on the throat of the ungrateful and malcontent will do; the fear of sudden and brutal reprisal keeping millions of desperate souls in line. This monumental responsibility of maintaining order among the hellish confines of the hives falls to the Palanite Enforcers.*

*More akin to an army than a police force, the Enforcers trade in violence and control, purging settlements and habzones if even the faintest hint of sedition against Lord Helmwar’s rule is uncovered. All manner of crime is met with a swift and vicious response, for those that transgress against the Imperial House must be brought to justice before they can corrupt others with their recidivist dogma. Such brutality is born not of a cruelty among the Palanite Enforcers or the sadistic will of Lord Helmawr himself, but rather as a simple necessity. The Enforcers are always significantly outnumberedby the people they are meant to control, a thin line of shotguns and shock batons keeping billions of hivers under their yoke.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#gang-composition)

- Otherwise, the gang can consist of any mix of Palanite & Subjugator fighters.
- Must have at least 1 Ganger for each Leader and Champion in the gang.
- All fighters can have multiple equipment sets.
- Gangers must become Specialists to gain skills (as normal).

## SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#special-rules)

Follow normal rules as other gangs with the following exceptions:

- All fighters (except Juves) can carry any weapon types (no weapon type restrictions).

**Special Rules:** Tenacious, Hardcase, Faithful Protector.

### TENACIOUS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#tenacious)

If taken Out of Action while not yet activated this round, this fighter is not removed from the battlefield until after completing its activation.

### HARDCASE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#hardcase)

Hardcase Cyber-mastiffs are completely cybernetic and thus very hard to kill. A Hardcase Cyber-mastiff counts as being equipped with [light carapace armour](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#carapace) and a [respirator](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/personal-equipment#respirator).

### FAITHFUL PROTECTOR[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#faithful-protector)

While Standing (Active or Engaged) and within 3” of its owner, enemy fighters may not make a Coup de Grace against the owner.

In addition, if the owner is Standing and Engaged when activated, and the Hardcase Cyber-mastiff is within 6" of them, the Hardcase Cyber-mastiff may immediately be moved into base contact with one or more of the fighters Engaging the owner. Thismove counts as a free action.

*For as long as Mankind has utilised canines for hunting and companionship, it has used them to guard and to protect. In enforcing the laws of Lord Helmawr, canines are an invaluable tool, one that cannot be corrupted by the temptation of power or bribed by the lure of wealth. Their loyalty lies entirely with their masters and their dedication is unswerving.*

*As a matter of course, the canines that serve alongside the Palanite Enforcers of Necromunda are heavily-modified brutes, routinely fitted with armour to protect their vital organs and upgraded with bionics to enhance their performance. The nature of such enhancements varies, from advanced sensory arrays that can be tailored to the role of watchdog or hunting hound, to combat upgrades such as iron jaws and razor-edged fangs. It is these combat modifications that are seen most widely in the underhive and the gangs of Necromunda have rightly learned to fear the deployment of Hardcase Cyber-mastiffs on their turf.*

**Wargear:** [Light carapace armour](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#carapace).

**Special Rules:** Automated Repair Systems, Mobile Bulwark.

### AUTOMATED REPAIR SYSTEMS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#automated-repair-systems)

During the Recovery and Restart step of the End phase, do not roll if this fighter recovers from being Seriously Injured − it automatically recovers as if a Flesh Wound had been rolled on the Injury dice.

### MOBILE BULWARK[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#mobile-bulwark)

If a friendly fighter is in partial cover due to being obscured by a Sanctioner Automata, they instead count as being in full cover.

### OPTIONS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#options)

An Enforcer ‘Sanctioner’ Pattern Automata can replace their pacifier assault claw and/or heavy shock baton with one of the following:

| Upgrade | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Concussion cannon | +80 |
| Sanction pattern mancatcher | +100 |
| SLHG pattern assault ram ‘Sledge hammer’ | +40 |

An Enforcer ‘Sanctioner’ Pattern Automata can take the following additional grenades types for their grenade launcher array: •

| Upgrade | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Choke gas grenades | +35 |
| Scare gas grenades | +45 |
| Smoke grenades | +15 |
| Stun grenades | +25 |

An Enforcer ‘Sanctioner’ Pattern Automata can upgrade its light carapace armour to heavy carapace armour:

| Upgrade | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Heavy carapace armour | +20 |

*To keep Helmawr’s peace, Enforcers employ semi-sentient servo-automata designated ‘Sanctioners’. These hulking machines are driven by the cranial remains of a Palanite Enforcer whose personality profile matches those prescribed for ‘Sanctioner’ use − the subject given extensive psycho-conditioning before their brain is removed, dissected and placed within the confines of the automata. Unlike the ‘ambot’, which is driven by the animal instincts and nervous system of an Ambul, the Sanctioner has a human mind controlling its actions− albeit one devoid of emotion and dedicated utterly to the letter of the law. For this reason, gangs often call these machines ‘Lawtomata’, saying you’d find more mercy at the hands of a Corpse Grinder Cult than under the gaze of a Sanctioner.*

*A Sanctioner is armed and armoured for the pacification tasks it is so often required to undertake. Heavy carapace plates protect the already robust inner workings of the Sanctioner, making them largely immune to small arms fire or the crude melee weapons often employed in uprisings or by outlaw gangers. Some Enforcer units, such as the Subjugators, often uparmour their automata further, to deal with more heavily armed resistance. Even discounting all their armour, Sanctioners have a reputation for being notoriously difficult to kill, the massive cybernetica rising again and again after taking punishing amounts of weapons fire as their internal repair systems keep them going.*

*The hulking automata’s arms incorporate weapons for both crowd control and gang warfare − one arm ending in a pacifier assault claw, known to criminals and gangs as the ‘Fist of Dread’ for the brutal damage it can inflict. Alternatively, it can replace the fist with a concussion cannon, an ideal weapon for stunning foes before hauling them off to the local Precinct-Fortress. Its other arm is equipped with a sanction pattern mancatcher to restrain and detain any who get in its way.*

*A Sanctioner is able to engage targets at longer range using an integrated grenade launcher. Grenades are a favoured tool of the Enforcers because of the variety of situations they can deal with − and the Sanctioner is no different. Flash, choke, scare and stun grenades are all useful to break up crowds or take the fight out of criminals, while smoke grenades provide cover for advancing Enforcers.*

*Sanctioners are usually only released from their storage chambers within a Precinct-Fortress in the case of large scale hive uprisings, though occasionally patrol sergeants might find themselves using them to bring law and order to especially wild regions of the underhive. In the wake of the Great Darkness, with loyalties divided and general unrest across all of Necromunda, more and more Sanctioners have been activated, while the number of ‘volunteers’ chosen to donate their brains to bolster the robot’s ranks has increased tenfold.*

## PALANITE ENFORCERS IN DOMINION CAMPAIGNS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#palanite-enforcers-in-dominion-campaigns)

An Enforcer Patrol can be fielded in a Dominion Campaign if players wish (see the Necromunda Rulebook), but due to their nature will function differently to other gangs in a few important ways.

### TERRITORIES AND CAMPAIGN PHASES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#territories-and-campaign-phases)

Enforcers cannot occupy and control Territories like other gangs can. Instead, they start the campaign in control of a single Territory unique to them – the Palanite Precinct Territory.

**Occupation Phase:** During the Occupation phase, Enforcers may challenge another gang for a nominated unoccupied Territory as normal. Similarly, another gang may challenge the Enforcers to fight for a nominated unoccupied Territory as normal. If the Enforcers win, rather than take control of the Territory, they must perform either a Police Territory or Grant Territory action (as follows).

**Takeover Phase:** During the Takeover phase, the Enforcers may challenge any gang for a Territory that gang controls. If the Enforcers win, they must perform either a Police Territory or Grant Territory action (as follows).

If, however, another gang challenges the Enforcers during the Takeover phase then the gang is assumed to be launching a bold assault against the Enforcers’ Palanite Precinct Territory (as follows). The challenger cannot gain control of the Palanite Precinct, but will gain the benefits of a successful assault should they win. The Enforcers cannot lose the Palanite Precinct, but can suffer the negative effects associated with it being successfully assaulted.

### TERRITORY ACTIONS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#territory-actions)

If the Enforcers win control of an unoccupied or enemy-held Territory, they must perform one of the following actions during the Wrap-up:

**Police Territory:** The Enforcers clear up the Territory. In a series of shock assaults and raids, they shut down criminal enterprises and flush out troublemakers:

- The Enforcers gain control of the Territory, but they gain no Boons from it.
- Immediately after taking control of the Territory and after every successful defence of the Territory, the Enforcers gain D3+1 Reputation for purging the Territory of crime.

**Grant Territory:** The Enforcer player chooses another gang taking part in the campaign. That gang gains control of the Territory andanyCriminal Enterprises associated with it.

### TRIUMPHS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#triumphs)

Players of Palanite Enforcers may not be awarded the Dominator Triumph. Instead they have a unique Peacemaker Triumph to reach for:

**Peacemaker:** If none of the players can be awarded the Dominator Triumph – because two or more players hold the same number of Territories – the Enforcer is awarded the Peacemaker Triumph.

### UNIQUE TERRITORY – PALANITE PRECINCT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#unique-territory--palanite-precinct)

Fortress, gaol, and place of execution, a Palanite Precinct is the authority of Lord Helmwar stamped boldly into the very structure of the underhive in rockcrete and plasteel for all to see.

### HOMEGROUND[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#homeground)

If challenged in the Takeover phase, the ensuing battle will automatically take place within the Palanite Precinct, representing a bold gang assaulting the Precinct:

- When the Palanite Precinct is assaulted, the battle will automatically be fought using Zone Mortalis terrain.
- The player that controls the Enforcers sets upall of the tiles, doors, barricades and any other terrain features. They also can decide if any of the doors are locked. The player who controls the Enforcers treats all doors as unlocked, and can relock any door.
- The player who controls the Enforcers automatically has the Home Turf Advantage when the Palanite Precinct is assaulted.

### TERRITORY BOON[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/palanite-enforcers/#territory-boon)

**Income:** The gang earns D6x10 credits from this Territory when collecting income.

**Gang Assault:** A gang can never take control of a Palanite Precinct. If, however, a gang should assault the Palanite Precinct and win the ensuing battle, that gang will gain +5 Reputation.

# BADZONE ENFORCERS

*The Palanite Enforcers keep Lord Helmawr's Peace throughout the underhives of Necromunda, often at the end of a shock baton or boltgun. Being the most overt and visible sign of Lord Helmawr's total dominion over Necromunda, the Palanite Enforcers are rightfully feared wherever they go.*

*However, like much on Necromunda, appearances can be deceptive. Out in the badzones of the underhive, regular communication and consistent supply lares are impossible. However, the hive world's inhabitants cannot be allowed to believe they are beyond Helmawr's gaze. This leads to Precinct-Fortresses being set up far from the warmth of the hive's central heat sink. Initially well-supplied and with a full complement of Enforcers, these lone beacons of order are them left to their own devices to maintain the Pax Helmawr as best they can.*

*Isolated as they are, Badzone Precinct Captains must abandon many of the restrictions their fellow Enforcers operate under if they are to survive, often abolishing the delineation of their forces between Palanites and Subjugators and even deputising hive scum to bulk out their numbers. Occasionally, an especially promising scum even gets accepted within the Badzone Enforcers' ranks; after all, losses must be replaced somehow. In addition, with limited resupplies of armaments making it through to them, Badzone Enforcers must rely upon whatever they can seize from other badzone elements or trade for on the open markets, with the more specialist equipment ending up in the hands of the Captains and Sergeants alone.*

The following section, along with the Palanite Enforcers list, provide all the rules needed top run a Badzone Enforcers gang in your campaigns of Necromunda.

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/badzone-enforcers/#gang-composition)

Enforcers follow [normal rules](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation) with the following exceptions:

- Must have at least 1 Ganger per Leader / Champion.

Cannot benefit from or participate in **Leading By Example** or **Group Activation**.

Does not trigger Nerve tests to friendly fighters without this special rule within 3” (when Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action).

NOTE

Enlisted Hive Scum are not exactly Juves. They promote after 5 advancements like Juve. Stats like Ganger / Hive Scum. Hot-headed like Specialist Juve (Prospect). And promoted to Ganger! But they don't have Fast Learner advancement discount.

So it is entirely unclear how they spend XP. To make things easy, they will be treated as Juves here.

# GENESTEALER CULT

*Few threats to the Imperium are as insidious as that posed by the Genestealer. A perfectly crafted organism, its sole purpose is to infiltrate and subvert the populations of entire worlds.*

*Genestealer Cults are utterly loyal to their leaders in a way not even the word-keepers of House Cawdor could hope to impose. It is a link forged of genetics, a compulsion woven into each member’s flesh, and thus utterly unbreakable. Without the direct influence of a brood lord, or the specialised mutations of the fourth generation, these splinter cults instead serve the strongest among their kind, often drawn from the first and second generation of their bloodline. These Cult Adept and Cult Alpha are far longer-lived than their heritage would suggest, as if their blood, mixed with that of the xenos, responds to the psychic needs of their family and so strengthens and elevates them. Under their sway hybrid Acolytes and Neophytes serve as foot soldiers, many passing for human, and even those who cannot are often mistaken for merely yet another of Necromunda’s countless mutant inhabitants. Aberrants too can be found within the splinter cults, mistakes of biology, nonetheless given purpose in battle against the cult’s enemies.*

*Almost all splinter cults are grown from mining families, and even generations on they use this guise to exist unnoticed among a world of humans. Clad in hazard suits and armed with a variety of scavenged weapons, mostly mining tools, splinter cults can form formidable gangs, as even the most primitive of blades can prove deadly when wielded by the hand of those who believe so completely in their cause. Tragically though, at least for the cult, their lifecycle remains stunted. Perhaps because of their separation from their distant brood father, Purestrains remain denied to them. In all likelihood, however, true glory still slumbers within the flesh of the family’s members and should the brood father ever call them to his side, they will continue their march towards the next stage of their deadly evolution.*

*There is no way to tell how many of these splinter cults exist on Necromunda, cut off from the broodthing of Secundus, growing ever larger without any real goal save expanding their territories and extending their bloodline. A few though have made their mark, their names growing in the dark and cursed by their enemies, though still far beneath the notice of the Imperial House and its vast armies.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#gang-composition)

A Genestealer Cults gang must follow these rules when it is founded and when new fighters are added to the gang:

- There must be one Leader, this may be either a Cult Adept or a Cult Alpha, chosen when the gang is first founded.
- The total number of Neophyte Hybrids in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the total number of other fighters (Leader, Hybrid Acolytes and Aberrants) in the gang, not counting Hangers-on.
- A fighter can be equipped with a maximum of three weapons. Weapons marked with an asterisk (*) take up the space of two weapons.
- Any fighter may take Wargear.
- Weapon accessories marked with a dagger (†) may not be combined together on the same weapon. If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon, another may not be added.

During a campaign, all gangs continue to follow the above rules as new fighters are added to the gang. Additionally, the following rules apply:

- A gang founded for a campaign can contain no more than two Hybrid Acolytes. Additional Hybrid Acolytes may be added to the gang during the course of the campaign.
- During the course of a campaign, any fresh recruits added to the gang may be equipped with items currently held in the gang’s Stash, rather than purchasing new equipment.
- During the course of the campaign, gangs may gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from the Trading Post or as a result of Territory Boons. These items are added to the gang’s Stash and may be distributed among fighters during any post-battle sequence:
- A fighter cannot be given a new weapon of a type not allowed by their entry within this gang list. Aberrants and Neophyte Hybrids cannot be given a new weapon if it would take them above the limit of three weapons carried.
- A Leader or Hybrid Acolyte can be given more than three weapons as they can have multiple Fighter cards, each representing a different ‘set’ of equipment, as described on page 95 of the Necromunda Rulebook.
- A fighter may discard any Wargear carried when given new Wargear. Discarded Wargear is placed in the gang’s Stash.

## SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#special-rules)

### EXTRA ARM[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#extra-arm)

- +1 weapon slot (4 instead of 3).
- Can attack with 3 weapons (Sidearm/Melee) in close combat (instead of 2).

If armed with a ranged Unwieldy weapon:

- Shooting ranged Unwieldy weapons becomes a Basic action (instead of Double).

Otherwise:

- +1 unarmed Attack with Rending (regardless of the weapons used).

### GAINING EXPERIENCE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#gaining-experience)

Genestealer Cults gain experience like normal. Aberrants advance like Gangers.

### CAPTURED FIGHTERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#captured-fighters)

Members of a Genestealer Cult are worth more when sold to the Guilders; the gang that is selling them receives their full value in credits instead of half their value.

### LOSS OF A LEADER[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#loss-of-a-leader)

Nominate a new leader in the following order:

1. Champion
2. Ganger
3. Specialist
4. Otherwise:Use Leadership as first tie-breaker and number of Advancements as second tie-breaker. If there is still a tie, choose one. The fighter becomes an Adept if they are a later generation (no Extra Arm) or Alpha if the fighter is early generation (Extra Arm). From now on they count as a Leader for determining which equipment and skill sets they can access. Their characteristics do not change.

### CAMPAIGN[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#campaign)

Claim Resource bonuses just like any other gang.

**Dominion:** Treated as an Orlock gang for the purposes of gang specific Resource bonuses.

### SPECIAL RESOURCES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#special-resources)

- Settlements generate free Gangers (later generation, no Extra Arm) instead of Juves.
- Genestealer Cults can't have a Guilder Contact Resource (re-roll the result). If a Guilder Contact Resource is stolen from another gang, it is simply removed instead.

### POST-BATTLE ACTIONS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#post-battle-actions)

- If any member of the gang is escorted to the Doc with a Medical Escort action, the cost is increased to 3D6x10 credits.
- Genestealer Cult gangs can't make the Sell to the Guilders action.
- Should the gang fail to rescue a captive held by a Genestealer Cult gang then the Cult can make them disappear - simply remove the captive from the campaign.

### HANGERS-ON, HIRED GUNS AND DRAMATIS PERSONAE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#hangers-on-hired-guns-and-dramatis-personae)

Genestealer Cults gangs may hire Dramatis Personae and Hive Scum in the same way as other gangs. Dramatis Personae Bounty Hunters joining a Genestealer Cults gang are subject to the Dead, Not Alive, Claiming Bounties and “We’ll Get Our Bit…" special rules.

Additionally, Genestealer Cults gangs may hire Hangers-on, but they use the following table:

| Reputation | Maximum Hangers-on |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 10 | 1 |
| 10 to 14 | 2 |
| 15 to 19 | 3 |
| 20 to 24 | 4 |
| Each additional 5 | +1 |

## GENESTEALER CULTS WYRD POWERS[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#genestealer-cults-wyrd-powers)

Genestealer Cults Adepts are Psykers, drawing their powers from their connection to the distant Patriarch of the wider cult that this gang represents one creeping tendril of. A Cult Adept has access to the Cult Wyrd Power list below as one of their Primary skill sets.

### 1. TELEPATHY – HYPNOSIS (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#1-telepathy--hypnosis-basic)

*With little more than a piercing stare, the Adept can dominate the minds of the weaker-willed.*

Select an enemy fighter that is both within 9" and line of sight of the Adept, and that has not been activated this turn. If the Willpower check to perform this action is successful, that fighter may only perform a single Move (Simple) action when activated this round.

### 2. TELEPATHY – UNBREAKABLE WILL (BASIC), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#2-telepathy--unbreakable-will-basic-continuous-effect)

*The Adept channels some measure of the Patriarch’s control over nearby cult members.*

Whenever a Nerve or Willpower test is made for another fighter from the gang who is within 9" of the Adept, use the Adept’s Cool or Willpower characteristic value (whichever is appropriate).

### 3. TELEPATHY – ZEALOT (DOUBLE), CONTINUOUS EFFECT[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#3-telepathy--zealot-double-continuous-effect)

*The mere presence of the Adept can drive their cult brethren to acts of aggressive hatred.*

Once per turn, when another fighter from the same gang that is within 9" of the Adept makes a Fight (Basic) or Charge (Double) action, any dice that roll a 1 to hit may be re-rolled.

### 4. TELEPATHY – MIND CONTROL (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#4-telepathy--mind-control-basic)

*Twitching and spasming under the control of the Adept, an enemy fighter is forced to slowly raise their weapon and take aim upon one of their friends.*

Select an enemy fighter that is within 9" of the Adept. That fighter immediately makes a Shoot (Basic) action, even if they have already activated this round, targeting an eligible fighter from their gang, chosen by the Genestealer Cults player.

NOTE

This version of Mind Control is different to the [Mind Control in the expanded list](https://necrovox.org/docs/the-rules/wyrd-powers#1-mind-control-basic-continuous-effect) from Book of the Outcast. This does not require line of sight. It is also not Continuous Effect.

### 5. TELEKINESIS – ASSAIL (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#5-telekinesis--assail-basic)

*The Adept uses the force of their will to push enemies from their path.*

Immediately make a ranged attack against an enemy fighter within 12" and line of sight. If hit, move the target D3" in any direction – if they were Standing, they become Prone and Pinned after moving. If they come into base contact with a Standing fighter or any terrain, they stop moving and suffer a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit. If they come into base contact with another fighter, that fighter also suffers a Strength 3, Damage 1 hit and becomes Prone and Pinned.

### 6. TELEKINESIS – FORCE BLAST (BASIC)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/genestealer-cult/#6-telekinesis--force-blast-basic)

Any enemy fighters within 3" of this Psyker are immediately pushed D3+1" directly away. If this movement would push a fighter from a platform or into a pitfall, stop them at the edge and take an Initiative test for them. If the test is passed, they are placed Prone at the edge. If the test is failed, they will fall. If this movement is interrupted by a wall or other impassable terrain, the fighter is immediately Pinned and takes a hit with a Strength equal to the number of inches rolled for the push distance.

**Skills:** [Clamber](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#2-clamber).

**Wargear:** None (always makes unarmed attacks).

A fighter who is turned into a Chaos Spawn is effectively slain and their equipment is lost. They are immediately replaced with a Chaos Spawn. The Spawn is added for free, but the cost affects Gang Rating. Roll a separate D6 for each ? in the profile and consult the table below. This is the Spawn’s characteristics which can't be altered in any way.

| D6 | WS | S | T | W | I | A |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 2-5 | 4+ | 4 | 5 | 2 | 4+ | 2 |
| 6 | 3+ | 5 | 6 | 3 | 3+ | 3 |
- Can only make the following actions: Move, Charge, Fight and Coup de Grace.
    - Can't be, suffer, use or gain any of the following:
    - Pinned.
    - Seriously Injured.
    - Flesh Wounds.
    - Lasting Injuries (if taken Out of Action, it is automatically restrained after the battle).
    - Broken or Insane.
    - Weapons or equipment of any kind (always make unarmed attacks).
    - Experience or Advancements (in any way).
- Automatically:
    - Passes any Cool or Willpower tests.
    - Fails any Leadership or Intelligence tests.

After a battle that featured the Chaos Spawn, nominate up to 3 Gangers (not Out of Action or Seriously Injured at the end of the battle). Roll a D6 for each nominated Ganger: on a 4+, the Chaos Spawn is restrained; otherwise it scurries away to join the other nameless horrors of the Underhive and is removed from the gang. If a dice scores a 1, the Ganger suffers a Lasting Injury roll from the unfettered wrath of the Spawn.

# CORPSE GRINDER CULT

*A cannibal sickness lurks at the heart of Necromunda, like a festering wound that will never heal. It is the great cycle of existence that rules over all who serve the Imperial House, the denizens of the hives either feeding on their predecessors, or feeding the living with their own dead flesh. Corpse Grinder Cults are a by-product of this brutal necessity, charged with the grim task of recycling their fellow hivers into corpse-starch. The Great Houses of Necromunda are intimately familiar with the Corpse Grinder Cults, for they are a plague that rises from within the mortuary combines and Corpse Guilds with regular frequency. Even in the unrelenting horror of the hive, those forced to recycle corpses sometimes rebel against reality, losing their sanity among the whirr of the meat-saw and wet crunch of the bone-grinders. Where once a creature of reason and temperance stood, now a hollow shell consumed by hunger remains – the perfect vessel for the corrupting touch of Chaos to infect.*

*Corpse Grinder Cults often start within the hallowed ranks of the Corpse Guilds. From among the toiling workers a leader will arise. Whether these deranged individuals draw the gaze of the Blood God with their cannibal madness or if it is the influence of the Dark God who turns honest men to feast upon the cutting floor is unclear. The result, however, is the same. Over time, a cult leader will become stronger and more ravenous, the growling voice of Khorne driving them to murder so that they might feast upon warmand bloody flesh. Around these debased leaders, deviant cults are formed. Prospective followers might be drawn from within the mortuary manufactorums, or from the greater hive populace. At first trusted members are inducted, and offered a taste of the gory bounty smuggled out of production lines. Thus are entire families and hab communities corrupted, most knowing only that the meat gives them strength and endurance like nothing they have known, unaware of the dark blessing surrounding the cult leader.*

## GANG COMPOSITION[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/#gang-composition)

A Corpse Grinder Cult gang must follow these rules when it is founded and when new fighters are added to the gang:

- There must be one Leader (Butcher) chosen when the gang is first founded.
- The total number of Initiates in the gang must always be equal to, or higher than, the number of other Skinners in the gang.
- The gang may only ever include a maximum of 0-3 Champions (Cutters) at any time.
- A fighter can be equipped with a maximum of three weapons. Weapons marked with an asterisk (*) take up the space of two weapons.
- Any fighter may take Wargear.
- Weapon accessories marked with a dagger (†) may not be combined together on the same weapon. If one such accessory is purchased for a weapon, another may not be added.

During an Uprising Campaign, gangs continue to follow the above rules as new fighters are added to the gang. Additionally, the following rules apply:

- During the course of an Uprising Campaign, any fresh recruits added to the gang may be equipped with items currently held in the gang’s Stash, rather than purchasing new equipment.
- During the course of the campaign, gangs may gain new equipment, either by purchasing it from the gang’s House Equipment List or as a result of Scavenging. These items are added to the gang’s Stash and may be distributed among fighters during any post-battle sequence:
    - A fighter cannot be given a new weapon of a type not allowed by their entry within their House List.
    - Leaders and Champions can be given additional weapons, but if they have more than three weapons, they will have to fill out multiple Fighter cards, each representing a different ‘set’ of equipment.
    - A fighter may discard any Wargear carried when given new Wargear. Discarded Wargear is placed in the gang’s Stash.

## SPECIAL RULES[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/#special-rules)

In a Dominion Campaign, Corpse Grinder Cult gangs are treated just like any other; they begin the campaign with a Settlement Territory which they cannot lose, representing their base of operations. They can take control of unoccupied Territories during the Occupation phase and they can seize control of Territories from other gangs during the Takeover phase.

Settlement Territories do not generate Juves; instead, each D6 roll of a 6 generates a free Initiate. If both of the D6s roll a 6, this becomes a single Skinner.

Despite their secret agenda, a Corpse Grinder Cult gang is seen as just another gang by most of the locals. They claim Territory Boons just like any other gang. Additionally, a Corpse Grinder Cult gang gains Enhanced Boons for a Corpse Farm Territory as if they were a Cawdor gang and from a Fighting Pit Territory as if they were a Goliath gang.

### OUTLAW[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/#outlaw)

A Corpse Grinder Cult gang is automatically an [Outlaw gang](https://necrovox.org/docs/founding-a-gang/gang-creation#outlaw-gangs).

### AGENTS OF MISRULE[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/#agents-of-misrule)

In a Law and Misrule Campaign, Corpse Grinder Cult gangs start aligned to Misrule. They cannot change their alignment over the course of the campaign.

### BLESSED BY THE LORD OF SKIN AND SINEW[](https://necrovox.org/docs/gangs/gang-lists/corpse-grinder-cult/#blessed-by-the-lord-of-skin-and-sinew)

DESIGNER'S COMMENTARY

Presented below are special rules that will allow you to recreate the events described in Sump City Sinking. If the Arbitrator wishes, these rules can be used by any Delaque gang during a campaign.

When a Corpse Grinder Cult fighter with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule is activated, their controlling player may attempt to Invoke the Dark Gods before performing any actions.

**Invoke the Dark Gods:** This fighter makes a Willpower test, with a +3 modifier if they took an enemy fighter Out of Action in their previous activation. If the test is failed, roll an Injury dice apply the result immediately to this fighter. If the test is passed, the fighter gains the following benefits for the duration of this activation:

- +1 to their Strength, Toughness and Attacks characteristics.
- Roll a D6 at the end of their activation. On a result of a 4+, they can remove a single Flesh Wound or recover a single lost Wound.
