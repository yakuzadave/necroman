      "Effect": "If the wound roll for a Web attack is successful, no wound is inflicted, and no save roll or Injury roll is made. Instead, the target automatically becomes Webbed. Treat the fighter as if they were Seriously Injured and roll for Recovery for them during the End phase. If a Flesh Wound result is rolled during Recovery, apply the result to the fighter as usual and remove the Webbed condition. If a Serious Injury is rolled, the fighter remains Webbed. If an Out of Action is rolled, the fighter succumbs to the web's sedative and is removed from play, automatically suffering a result of 12-26 Out Cold on the Lasting Injuries table. A fighter that is Webbed at the end of the battle does not succumb to their Injuries and will automatically recover. However, during the Wrap-up, when rolling to determine if any enemy fighters are Captured at the end of the battle, add +1 to the dice roll for each enemy fighter currently Webbed and include them among any eligible to be Captured."

If the score is equal to or higher than the target’s Strength, the target is dragged D3\" straight towards the attacker, stopping if they hit any terrain. If they move into another fighter (other than the attacker), both fighters are moved the remaining distance towards the attacker. If the weapon also has the Impale special rule and hits more than one fighter, only the last fighter to be hit can be dragged."

Trace a straight line from the target, directly away from the attacker. If there are any fighters within 1\" of this line, and within the weapon’s Long range, the one that is closest to the target is at risk of being hit. Roll a D6. On a 3 or more, resolve the weapon’s attack against that fighter, subtracting 1 from the Strength. The projectile can continue through multiple fighters in this way, but if the Strength is reduced to 0, it cannot hit any more fighters."

If the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (X) trait, then any additional hits generated from the Firepower dice must be distributed among the maximum number of eligible targets.

Gunked fighters reduce their Movement characteristic by 1 to a minimum of 1 and don’t add D3\" to their movement when making a Charge action. In addition, they subtract 1 from the dice roll when making an Initiative check. Gunked fighters are also more flammable and catch fire on a 2+, rather than a 4+, when hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait.\nThe Gunked condition lasts until the End phase or until the fighter catches fire after being hit by a weapon with the Blaze Trait."

Fixed weapons can only be moved by fighters who begin their activation in base contact with the weapon and take the Move Weapon (Double) action. This action allows a fighter to move up to their Movement characteristic and then place the weapon in base contact with themselves when they finish moving.\nFighters in base contact with a fixed weapon count it as if it were a weapon on their Fighter card (i.e., they can aim, shoot and reload it as normal), provided there are no enemy fighters also in base contact with the weapon."

      "Effect": "Instead of making a wound roll for a Toxin attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal or higher than the target’s Toughness, or a natural 6, make an Injury roll (regardless of their Wounds characteristic). If the roll is lower than the target’s Toughness, they shrug off the toxin’s effects."

      "Trait": "Gas",
      "Effect": "When a fighter is hit by an attack made by a weapon with the Gas trait, they are not Pinned and a wound roll is not made. Instead, roll a D6. If the result is equal or higher than the target’s Toughness, or a natural 6, make an Injury roll (regardless of their Wounds characteristic). If the roll is lower than the target’s Toughness, they shrug off the effects of the gas – no save roll can be made against a weapon with this Trait."

    },
    {
      "Trait": "Limited",
      "Effect": "If a weapon fails an Ammo check while using Limited ammo, they have run out – that ammo type is deleted from their Fighter card, and can't be used again until more of that special ammo is bought. This is as well as the normal rules for the weapon running Out of Ammo. The weapon can still be reloaded as normal, using any remaining profile(s)."

      "Trait": "Unstable",
      "Effect": "If the Ammo symbol is rolled on the Firepower dice when attacking with this weapon, there is a chance that, as well as needing an Ammo check, the weapon will prove as hazardous to its user as the enemy. Roll a D6. On a 1, 2 or 3, something has gone wrong and the attacker is taken Out of Action. The attack is still resolved against the target."

    {
      "Trait": "Grenade",
      "Effect": "Despite being Wargear, grenades are treated as a special type of ranged weapon. A fighter equipped with grenades can throw one as a Shoot (Basic) action. Grenades do not have a Short range, and their Long range is determined by multiplying the fighter’s Strength by the amount shown. A fighter can only carry a limited number of grenades. The Firepower dice does not need to be rolled when attacking with a grenade. Instead, after the attack has been resolved, it is assumed that the Ammo symbol has been rolled and an Ammo check is made automatically. If this is failed, grenades can't be reloaded; the fighter has run out of that type of grenade and can't use them for the remainder of the battle."

      "Trait": "Digi",
      "Effect": "A Digi weapon can be used as well as any other Melee weapon carried by the fighter, granting an additional close combat attack which must be made with this weapon. A weapon with this Trait does not count towards the maximum number of weapons a fighter can carry. However, the maximum number of weapons with this Trait a fighter can carry is 10."
    },
    {
      "Trait": "Blaze",
      "Effect": "After an attack with the Blaze trait has been resolved, roll a D6 if the target was hit but not taken Out of Action. On a 4, 5 or 6, they become subject to the Blaze condition. When activated, a fighter subject to the Blaze condition suffers an immediate Strength 3, AP -1, Damage 1 hit and must act as follows, after which their activation will end:\n• If Prone and Pinned the fighter immediately becomes Standing and Active and acts as described below.\n• If Standing and Active the fighter moves 2D6\" in a random direction, determined by the Scatter dice. The fighter will stop moving if this movement would bring them within 1\" of an enemy fighter or into base contact with impassable terrain. If this movement brings them within 1⁄2\" of the edge of a level, platform or pitfall, they risk falling. If this movement takes the fighter beyond the edge of a level, platform or pitfall, they will simply fall. At the end of this move, the fighter may choose to become Prone and Pinned. The fighter may then attempt to put the fire out.\n• If Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the fighter does not move and attempts to put the fire out. To attempt to put the fire out, roll a D6, adding 1 to the result for each other Active friendly fighter within 1\". On a result of 6 or more, the flames go out and the Blaze marker is removed. Pinned or Seriously Injured fighters add 2 to the result of the roll to see if the flames go out."

      "Trait": "Hexagramatic",

    },
    {
      "Trait": "Graviton Pulse",
      "Effect": "Instead of rolling to wound normally with this weapon, any fighter caught in the Blast must instead roll equal or under their Strength on a D6 (a roll of 6 always counts as a fail), or suffer Damage with no armour save roll allowed. After the weapon has been fired, leave the Blast marker in place. For the remainder of the round, any fighter moving through this area will use 2\" of their Movement for every 1\" they move. Remove the Blast marker during the End phase."
    },
    {
      "Trait": "Demolitions",
      "Effect": "Grenades with the Demolitions trait can be used when making close combat attacks against scenery targets (such as locked doors or scenario objectives). A fighter who uses a grenade in this way makes one attack (regardless of how many Attack dice they would normally roll), which hits automatically."
    },
    {
      "Trait": "Knockback",
      "Effect": "If the hit roll for a weapon with the Knockback trait is equal or higher than the target’s Strength, they are immediately moved 1\" directly away from the attacking fighter. If the fighter can't be moved the full 1\" because of impassable terrain or another fighter, they move as far as possible and the attack’s Damage is increased by 1. If a Blast weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each fighter that is hit. If the result is equal or higher than their Strength, they are knocked back as described above – however, they are moved directly away from the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base, roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are moved. If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait, the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target up, moving directly towards them after they have been knocked back to remain in base contact. If the attack was made across a barricade, the attacker can't do this. If any part of the knocked back fighter‘s base crosses the edge of a platform, make an Initiative check. If this is failed, they will fall. If this is passed, they stop moving at the edge of the platform."
    },
    {
      "Trait": "Silent",
      "Effect": "In scenarios that use the Sneak Attack special rules, there is no test to see whether the alarm is raised when this weapon is fired. Additionally, if using the Pitch Black rules, a fighter using this weapon that is Hidden does not become Revealed."

    {

      "Effect": "If the attacker is not within the target’s vision arc, add 1 to the attack’s Strength."

    {
      "Trait": "Flare",
      "Effect": "A fighter who takes a hit from a weapon with the Flare Trait, or who is touched by a Blast marker fired from a weapon with the Flare Trait, is Revealed if the battlefield is in darkness (see Pitch Black from page 120 of the Necromunda Rulebook). If a weapon has both the Flare Trait and the Blast Trait after determining where the Blast marker ends up, leave it in place. In the End phase, roll a D6. On a 4 or more, the flare goes out and the marker is removed, otherwise it remains in play. While the Blast marker is on the board, all models at least touched by it are illuminated as if they had a Blaze marker or a Revealed marker"
    },
    {
      "Trait": "Versatile",
      "Effect": "The wielder of a Versatile weapon does not need to be in base contact with an enemy fighter in order to Engage them in melee. During their activation or when making Reaction attacks, they may Engage and make close combat attacks against an enemy fighter so long as the distance between their base and that of the enemy fighter is equal or less than the distance shown for the Versatile weapon’s Long range characteristic. An enemy fighter is considered to be Engaged by a fighter armed with a Versatile weapon if they are within both the Long range of the Versatile weapon and the Vision Arc of that fighter. An enemy fighter may not in turn be Engaging the fighter armed with the Versatile weapon unless they too are armed with a Versatile weapon, and so may not be able to make Reaction attacks. At all times other than during this fighter’s activation or when making Reaction attacks, this Trait has no effect."
    },
    {
      "Trait": "Shield",
      "Effect": "A shield grants a +2 armour save modifier (to a maximum of 2+) against melee attacks that originate from within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc to their front), and a +1 armour save modifier against ranged attacks that originate from within the fighter’s vision arc; check this before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear whether the attacker is within the target’s front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the arc, the energy shield can be used. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the target does not have a facing (for example, if they are Prone), the energy shield can't be used."

    {
      "Trait": "Parry",
      "Effect": "After an enemy makes close combat attacks against a fighter armed with a Parry weapon, the fighter can force the attacking player to re-roll one successful hit. If the fighter is armed with two Parry weapons, they can force the attacking player to re-roll two successful hits instead."

      "Trait": "Rapid Fire (X)",
      "Effect": "When firing with a Rapid Fire weapon, a successful hit roll scores a number of hits equal to the number of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. In addition, the controlling player can roll more than one Firepower dice, up to the number shown in brackets (for example, when firing a Rapid Fire (2) weapon, up to two Firepower dice can be rolled). Make an Ammo check for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail, the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more of them fail, the gun has jammed and can't be used for the rest of the battle. If a Rapid Fire weapon scores more than one hit, the hits can be split between multiple targets. The first must be allocated to the original target, but the remainder can be allocated to other fighters within 3\" of the first who are also within range and line of sight. These must not be any harder to hit than the original target – if a target in the open is hit, an obscured target can't have hits allocated to it. Allocate all of the hits before making any wound rolls."
    },
    {
      "Trait": "Smoke",
      "Effect": "Smoke weapons do not cause hits on fighters – they do not cause Pinning, and can't inflict wounds. Instead, mark the location where they hit with a counter. They generate an area of dense smoke, which extends 2.5\" out from the centre of the counter, vertically as well as horizontally. Fighters can move through the smoke, but it blocks line of sight, so attacks can't be made into, out of or through it. In the End phase, roll a D6. On a 4 or less, the cloud dissipates and the counter is removed."

      "Trait": "Flash",
      "Effect": "If a fighter is hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, no wound roll is made. Instead, make an Initiative check for the target. If it is failed, they become subject to the Blind condition. A Blind fighter loses their Ready marker; if they do not have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the following round. Until the next time the fighter is activated, they can't make any attacks other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will only succeed on a natural 6."

    {
      "Trait": "Melta",

    {
      "Trait": "Single Shot",
      "Effect": "This weapon can only be used once per battle. After use, it counts as having automatically failed an Ammo check. There is no need to roll the Firepower dice unless the weapon also has the Rapid Fire (X) trait."
